ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; WHITENESS
AB This study uses critical race theory (CRT) to uncover racialized interactions that influence legislative processes. The transcripts from public hearings from the 2017 Nevada State legislative session were included in the data analysis. Results demonstrate the utility of CRT as an analytic tool to examine the policy-making process, identify narratives that sustain and protect white supremacy imbedded in policies governing high school education, and uncover racist testimony throughout the policy-making process. More specifically, results demonstrate the ways that subtle racialized interactions drive conversations where White constituents protect white interests at the expense of racial equity. Conversely, findings highlight how People of Color issue a counternarrative by providing necessary historical context and perspectives to work toward racial justice goals.
