AB The zygomatic root, along with other key craniofacial features, is hypothesized to play a crucial role in strengthening the face in response to stresses and strains related to feeding. As such, it has been cited as indicative of dietary specialization among fossil taxa, although it remains unknown how variable zygomatic arch root position is among living primates, and whether its positioning predicts differences in diet. We test whether primates that consume more mechanically challenging foods possess more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots compared to those consuming less challenging foods. Zygomatic root position, as defined by the zygomaxillare landmark, was identified and recorded from digital images and physical specimens of adult primate crania. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species (n = 722). Published data were used to assign species to a dietary type based on patterns of overall consumption along with reliance on especially challenging foods. Pairwise comparisons between mechanically challenging (hard and/or tough) and less mechanically challenging (soft) consumers found significant differences (p < 0.05) in the position of the zygomatic root in 17 of 20 pairs, 11 of which supported the prediction that a more mechanically challenging diet is associated with a more anteriorly placed zygomatic root. PGLS analysis found no significant effect of phylogeny on root position. This suggests that a more anteriorly positioned zygomatic root is useful for identifying dietary specialization in some taxa but is not required for consuming a mechanically challenging diet given that other craniofacial and behavioral factors can facilitate the consumption of such foods.
