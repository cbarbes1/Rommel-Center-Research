AB Purpose This study aimed to describe physical activity (PA) via the frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression (FITT-VP) principles of Native Americans (NA), it is necessary to understand their current PA. The purpose was to 1) evaluate PA levels utilizing FITT-VP principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women. Methods Recruitment and evaluation (n = 586) took place as part of the OPREVENT2 study baseline evaluation. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form assessed frequency (days per week), intensity (walking, moderate, vigorous), and time (minutes per day). The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d provided the volume of activity. Results The NA sample was 45.8 +/- 15.1 yr of age, with a body mass index of 31.5 +/- 6.4 kg center dot m(-2). The FIT-V corresponded to 4.7 +/- 2.3 d center dot wk(-1), walking (3.3 METs intensity), 52 +/- 47 min center dot d(-1), and 2536 +/- 2203 MET center dot min(-1). The men (n = 162) reported a greater frequency of 3.2 +/- 2.5 d center dot wk(-1) (P = 0.007) of vigorous activity lasting 55 +/- 50 min center dot d(-1) compared with the women (n = 433) with 2.6 +/- 2.5 d center dot wk(-1) of vigorous activity lasting 34 +/- 38 min center dot d(-1). The men reported higher MET-minutes than did the women (P = 0.0001). Overall, 71% of men and 77% of women met the recommended PA guidelines. Conclusions Given that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.
