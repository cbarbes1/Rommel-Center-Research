AB Most researchers observe a negative association between regulatory accumulation and traditional measures of entrepreneurship (i.e., firm startups and job formation). However, when measuring business activity with metrics common to the dynamism literature, researchers fail to find a significant association between regulation and startup activity. After ruling out differences in unit of measure, industry aggregation, and regulation measurement, we demonstrate that differences in entrepreneurship and dynamism measurement are potentially responsible for the conflicting results. However, we do find empirical evidence that the relationship between regulations and job creation rates varies across industries. In industries with high job creation rates in the prior period, increased regulations are associated with lower job creation rates in the current period. However, the opposite is true in industries with low job creation rates in the prior period (i.e., increased regulations are associated with higher job creation rates in the current period). Depending upon the vintage of the regulation dataset (i.e., RegData 2.0), a similar pattern holds for the startup rate.
