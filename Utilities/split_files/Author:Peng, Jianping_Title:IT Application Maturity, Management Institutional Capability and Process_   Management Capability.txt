AB This article studies the influence of enterprise core competence on IT application maturity (ITAM) from the perspectives of management institutional and process management capabilities. The roles of firm ownership and international organization of standard (ISO) certifications are also studied. Based on reliable and valid measurements of IT applications maturity, management institutional capability, and process management capability, the authors collect corresponding data from 123 companies in China. They find a positive relationship between capabilities and ITAM. Management institutional capability has a stronger relationship with ITAM in Chinese state-owned enterprises or public companies; while multinational companies or joint ventures witness a stronger relationship with process management capability. ISO helps companies with low management institutional capability to improve ITAM. However, for companies with higher management institutional capability, ISO mitigates the relationship and poses a shift of the importance to process management capability in improving ITAM.
