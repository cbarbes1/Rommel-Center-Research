AB Binary success/failure data is an important type of data which occurs in a wide range of fields and application domains. We examine a new overdispersed statistical distribution for this type of data which is particularly suited to 'big data' contexts. The distribution, called the tilted beta-binomial distribution, has a number of attractive properties with regard to tractability and interpretability. We apply the distribution to the analysis of Maryland population data from the 2010 U.S. Census. We find the tilted beta-binomial distribution provides a superior fit compared to the beta-binomial distribution in the current data set and provides new options for modeling success/failure data. In addition to addressing overdispersion, the distribution has implications for generating new insights by revealing underlying latent subgroups in data.
