AB In the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, early studies suggested a relationship between smaller crabs, which molt more frequently, and higher rates of infection by the dinoflagellate parasite, Hematodinium perezi. In order to better explore the influence of size and molting on infections, blue crabs were collected from the Maryland coastal bays and screened for the presence of H. perezi in hemolymph samples using a quantitative PCR assay. Molt stage was determined by a radioimmunoassay which measured ecdysteroid concentrations in blue crab hemolymph. Differences were seen in infection prevalence between size classes, with the medium size class (crabs 61 to 90 mm carapace width) and juvenile crabs (>= 30 mm carapace width) having the highest infection prevalence at 47.2% and 46.7%, respectively. All size classes were susceptible to infection, although fall months favored disease acquisition by juveniles, whereas mid-sized animals (31-90 mm carapace width) acquired infection predominantly in summer. Disease intensity was also most pronounced in the summer, with blue crabs > 61 mm being primary sources of proliferation. Molt status appeared to be influenced by infection, with infected crabs having significantly lower concentrations of ecdysteroids than uninfected crabs in the spring and the fall. We hypothesize that infection by H. perezi may increase molt intervals, with a delay in the spring molt cycle as an evolutionary adaptation functioning to coincide with increased host metabolism, providing optimal conditions for H. perezi propagation. Regardless of season, postmolt crabs harbored significantly higher proportions of moderate and heavy infections, suggesting that the process of ecdysis, and the postmolt recovery period, has a positive effect on parasite proliferation.
