AB Global human resource managers need to understand which personality characteristics contribute to leadership effectiveness in different cultures for both selection and training purposes. This meta-analysis demonstrates that leaders' emotional intelligence (EI) demonstrates incremental validity and relative weight in predicting subordinates' task performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) after controlling for the Big Five and cognitive ability. The relationship between leaders' El and subordinates' task performance is stronger in collectivistic, feminine, and high uncertainty avoidance cultures. The relationship between leaders' El and subordinates' OCB is stronger in high power distance, collectivistic, feminine, high uncertainty avoidance, long-term oriented, and restraint cultures.
