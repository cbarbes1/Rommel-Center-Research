AB The cost of textbooks is problematic for many students at American colleges as prices have increased by 140% in almost two decades (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). This economic injustice causes students to miss out on educational opportunities because they have to prioritize paying for their basic needs over textbooks. This article discusses a research study which explored students' perceptions of using an Open/Alternative Educational Resource (OAER), specifically a nontraditional textbook in a social work skills course. Overall, results support the notion that students are amenable to buying a low cost, nontraditional textbook option.
