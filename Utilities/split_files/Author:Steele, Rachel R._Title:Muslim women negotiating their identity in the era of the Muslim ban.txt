AB Muslim women experience gendered Islamophobia because their Muslim identity is often more visible and comes to symbolize their culture. Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one's Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one's Muslim identity in public. Microagressions and offence at Trump's proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump's statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.
