AB In 2016, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) was listed as federally threatened in the United States, due largely to declines from white-nose syndrome (WNS). The dramatic decline of this species heightens the significance of new occurrences outside the known range. Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD, located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this species in the era of WNS.
