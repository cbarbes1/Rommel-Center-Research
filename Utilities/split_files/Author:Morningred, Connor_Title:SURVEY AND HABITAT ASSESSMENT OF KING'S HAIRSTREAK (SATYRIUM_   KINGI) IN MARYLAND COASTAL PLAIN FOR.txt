AB We surveyed for caterpillars and adults of King's Hairstreak, Satyrium kingi (Klots and Clench, 1952), a globally vulnerable species found along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Surveys were conducted at three study sites with abundant Symplocos tinctoria (L.) L'Her. (Family: Symplocaceae), the caterpillar host plant. We found caterpillars at only one site using UV LED flashlights and adults at two of the three sites. Mating was not observed, and eggs were not found. We discuss observations of S. kingi adults and caterpillars, management of our study sites, data from habitat assessments, and recommendations for further study of S. kingi.
