AB This article evaluates how firms are able to enhance the effectiveness of their Risk Management Infrastructure (RMI) by using Big Data Analytics (BDA) to improve their risk resilience capability. A theoretical model is developed and the corresponding hypothesis is tested through a survey instrument and quantitative analysis. The results show that if firms adopt BDA capabilities then it positively moderates the impact of RMI on risk resilience, improving the effectiveness of a risk management infrastructure.
