AB Although considerable research has targeted fall prevention among older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), less is known about their ability to rise from the floor. The aim of the current exploratory study was to examine the relationship between floor rise and physical performance tests. A cross-sectional design was used. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age = 74.8 years, SD = 9.5 years) performed a standardized floor rise test and physical performance assess-ments in a structured task circuit. Mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 sec-onds (SD = 7.6 seconds). Fourteen (70%) participants used a quadruped strategy to rise to stand. Supine-to-stand performance time was significantly correlated with all physical performance measures. Findings serve as a catalyst for nursing and rehabilitation professionals to examine floor rise ability, prevent adverse effects of a critical fall, and instruct fall recovery techniques in clinical settings.
