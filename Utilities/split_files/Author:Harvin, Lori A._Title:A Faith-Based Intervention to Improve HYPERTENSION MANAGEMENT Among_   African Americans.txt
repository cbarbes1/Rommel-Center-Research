AB High mortality rates continue among African Americans related to complications of uncontrolled hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine if a faith-based self-management education program would improve self-care activities related to the management of hypertension among African American adults. Ten African American adults who reported a diagnosis of hypertension for 6 months or longer completed an 8-week education program focused on strategies for hypertension management. The education program was enhanced with the utilization of spiritual components of prayer, Scripture reading, and journaling.
