AB Economists largely agree that writing is fundamental to understanding and communicating economics and can serve as an effective way to teach students to "think like economists." However, only a small percentage of programs include writing-intensive courses, a major research paper, or a senior thesis, and even fewer devote class time to the writing process. This article provides a multi-dimensional classification of process-based writing assignments that are categorized according to two criteria: writing skill and economic understanding, and outlines how economists can use these approaches in a range of economic courses that do and do not include a research paper.
