AB Deforestation and global climate change are predicted to affect precipitation and agricultural productivity in the Amazon. Anecdotal evidence suggests that farmers are already being affected by changes in the timing and amount of precipitation, but there is little quantitative evidence on the mechanism by which precipitation affects production. This paper uses an innovative application of remote sensing and meteorological data to separate rainfall into green water (soil moisture that contributes to plant water use) and blue water (surface water), to estimate the impact of these water sources on the production and production efficiency of dairy in a mature colonization zone of the Brazilian Amazon. This approach allows us to draw inferences about different pathways through the precipitation-production causal chain and to link changes in precipitation with impacts on farm profits and welfare. We find that production and production efficiency are affected by green and blue water and that reductions in rainfall will have negative impacts that may disproportionally impact the poor. Our methods and results are informative to economists interested in this relatively new application of remote sensing data, to geographers interested in identifying the role of green and blue water in agricultural production, and more generally to researchers interested in the impacts of rainfall and water availability on small-scale producers in the Brazilian Amazon.

   Center (SESYNC) under funding received from the National Science
   Foundation DBI1052875. The authors are thank-ful to representatives of
   the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (Janaina de Almeida Rocha,
   Bernardo de Araujo Moraes TrovAo, Antonio Calazans Miranda, Rejane
   Marques Mendes, Jose angelo Ramalho Leal, and Leonardo Julian Rodrigues
   Klosovski) and repre-sentatives from the Secretary of the Environment in
   Rondonia, Bra-zil (Arquimedes Ernesto Longo and Deise Nunes Furlan) for
   attending our workshops and providing input on our research questions
   and approaches; and to our other research collaborators from the SESYNC
   FAR project (Becky Dickson, Jasmine Fuller, Dar Roberts, Thais Ottoni
   Santiago, Petterson Vale, Ricardo Vale, Thales West, and Yu Wu) for
   their support, curiosity and collegiality. In particular, we thank
   Petterson Vale for input that has strengthened our argument. The survey
   data used in this paper were funded by the National Science Foundation,
   under grant SES0752936. We would like to thank our survey team: Rafael
   Alves da Silva, Ander-son Boina, Alexsandro de Oliveira, Laize Sampaio
   Chagas e Silva, Maria Eliza Cota e Souza, Luzia Correa Dias, Liege Gehm,
   Juliana Gragnani, Julia Faro, Tania Cloilde R. Luz, Ivone Holz Seidel,
   and Priscilla Souza for their tireless efforts to complete the household
   surveys as well as the local residents of Ouro Preto do Oeste for their
   participation. Previous rounds of data collection were sup-ported by the
   National Science Foundation, SES-0452852 in 2005, SES-0076549 in 2000,
   and the National Security Education Program, the Organization of
   American States, the Institute for the Study of World Politics, and the
   McClure Fund Foundation in 1996. The household survey data used in the
   analysis can be found at the archive of social science data for research
   and instruction at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and
