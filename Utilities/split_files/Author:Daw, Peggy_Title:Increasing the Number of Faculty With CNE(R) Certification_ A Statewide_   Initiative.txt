AB This article describes outcomes of a statewide initiative to increase the number of faculty with the National League for Nursing's Certified Nurse Educator (CNE (R)) credential. After offering CNE preparation workshops and creating a certification award, data were collected on perceived workshop effectiveness, readiness to test, certification pass rates, and characteristics of award recipients. The number of certified faculty increased by 92.3 percent, representing 24 of 28 nursing programs. Maryland faculty were awarded $625,000 through the Academic Nurse Educator Certification award.
