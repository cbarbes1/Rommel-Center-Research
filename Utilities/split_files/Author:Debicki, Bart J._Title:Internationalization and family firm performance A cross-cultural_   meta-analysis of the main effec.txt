AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of internationalization on performance in family firms, as well as the potential impact of moderators on this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper is a meta-analysis of the impact of internationalization on performance in family firms, as well as the role of several moderators shaping this relationship, based on 29 studies.
   Findings
   The findings indicate a significant positive effect of internationalization on family firm performance. This relationship was stronger in family firms with lower family ownership. Several methodological moderators were significant, such as the means of measuring performance and internationalization. The results also point to several cultural moderators, such as individualism, masculinity, low uncertainty avoidance and short-term orientation, which positively influence the main effect.
   Originality/value
   The authors provide discussions of the results, their practical and theoretical implications, as well as avenues for future research.
