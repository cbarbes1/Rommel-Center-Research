AB How mundane or exotic the taste of a cuisine is considered, often determines what kind of visitors a restaurant is likely to get. However, restaurants find it difficult to both (i) gauge such customer expectations as well as (ii) target visitors with broad or narrow palates so as to successfully position their image and design offerings. The current research utilizes digital geolocation history data from restaurant check-ins along with Item Response Theory to identify mundane and exotic cuisines, and tastemakers with broader palates. Data is used from Chicago and San Francisco to compare definitions of exotic restaurant cuisines and tastemakers (visitors). In both cities, quick serve restaurants appear most mundane, while Lebanese and Turkish cuisine emerge as more exotic. Factors that explain palate diversity vary across the two cities.
