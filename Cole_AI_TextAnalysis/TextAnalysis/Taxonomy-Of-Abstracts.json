    "abstract": "The extant research sheds light on the vital role of co-creation in online healthcare communities (OHCs) as nascent peer-to-peer co-creation platforms in public health and well-being. However, more investigation of the underlying factors affecting patient value co-creation in OHCs is required. This study relies on the socio-technical theory to identify the social and technical factors that impact healthcare users' intention to co-create value. Analysis of survey data gathered from users of Top 10 healthcare-based pages on Facebook indicated that both social and technical factors are salient in the prediction of value co-creation in OHCs. More specifically, social support and its antecedents (i.e., perceived privacy risk and social media interactivity), as well as government IT infrastructures and perceived control of information, are found to be the critical antecedents of value co-creation intention. However, social support emerged as the most potent predictor of value co-creation relative to government IT infrastructures and control of information. The theoretical and practical contributions of the findings are discussed.",

  "abstract": "With the backdrop of the utility of grit at the individual level, speculation has begun to circulate that grit may exist as an organizational level phenomenon. To explore this potential construct, this study used an exploratory, qualitative research design. This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders' perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: \"What do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?\" Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.",

  "abstract": "Juvenile summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and southern flounder P. lethostigma inhabit turbid salt marsh estuaries. Predation rates by juveniles (50-90 mm) were examined at 5 daytime light levels (6 x 10(11) to 2 x 10(14) quanta s(-1) cm(-2)) and in darkness and 4 turbidity levels (clear [<= 1], 11, 20, and 40 NTU) at an intermediate light level. Both species fed equally well on benthopelagic mysid shrimp and benthic spionid polychaetes at all daytime light levels tested. However, predation on mysids was significantly reduced in the dark. Consumption of polychaetes was not reduced in the dark by either species, illustrating the effectiveness of non-visual foraging methods on benthic prey. Turbidity levels tested did not affect predation on either prey type by either flounder species. Locomotor behavior was examined at the same turbidity levels. P. lethostigma spent more time swimming in the water column than P. dentatus in lower turbidity (clear-20 NTU), and both species reduced swimming at 40 NTU. It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style for P. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species. Turbidity can thus alter foraging modes and types of prey consumed, affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base supporting these young fishes.",

  "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how firms can develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events, by developing big data analytics (BDA) capabilities within their organization. The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm's ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. Findings The analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm's ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization's existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization's ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events. Originality/value This study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. The study further provides a counterpoint to the existing perspective within the supply chain risk management literature that institutional experience of managing past supply chain disruption events prepares the organization to deal with future disruption events. This paper adds to our understanding of how, by adopting BDA capabilities, firms can develop supply chain risk resilience from disruption events.",

  "abstract": "We examine the effects of the balance between positive and negative affect experienced at work on well-being outcomes. An extensive literature on affect balance suggests that it is not only positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) alone that affect well-being; rather it is the balance between them that matters. We use experience sampling methods and polynomial regression to test the notion that daily PA and NA at work, along with their interactive and nonlinear effects, predict employee well-being after work. In a sample of working adults, we find that affect balance-the dynamic interplay between daily PA and NA-at work was differentially associated with various indices of well-being: PA, NA, and the interaction between them predicted physical and mental health. Affect balance at work also predicted life satisfaction, but only for those low on trait affect balance. Detailed examination of the joint effects of PA, NA, and the balance between them reveals that high PA at work is most important for life satisfaction, whereas both low NA and high PA are important for health. Low NA plays an especially important role in physical health.",

  "abstract": "In our contribution to this special issue on 'Chronotopes & the COVID-19 Pandemic', we discuss the complexities of human survival and its dependence on collective learning. We argue that collective learning - and thus survival - is a sociolinguistic phenomenon and lay out a fractal system in which the related sociolinguistic processes play out. This system highlights the chronotopic-scalar situatedness of survival and captures the material, textual, and imagined aspects of learning and meaning-making. Drawing on interactions among a small group of Iranian migrants dealing with the effects of COVID-19, we discuss the processes through which participants dynamically construct and update their chronotopic images of their new circumstances, as they interact with material and semiotic data coming from multiple scales/centers. We show how the normative-semiotic indeterminacies caused by COVID-19 are navigated by social actors as they make sense of their spatiotemporal surroundings in pursuit of material and ideological survival.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the practice of contemporary artist Cauleen Smith as an ongoing exploration of the aesthetic and political possibilities of cinematic space, place, and movement. Drawing upon a range of critical frameworks from cultural geography and Black feminism, it locates in Smith's work an aesthetics and politics of errantry that favors radically nonnormative forms of relation and mobility. Borrowing the term from Martinican novelist and critic Edouard Glissant, and drawing more broadly from his thoroughgoing elucidations of the spatial dynamics of colonialism, the plantation system, and their afterlives, the text frames Smith's cinematic errantry both as a formal and technological operation and as a political one grounded in a Black feminist praxis of place.",

  "abstract": "Prior research links adaptive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) with enhanced psychological well-being and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating) with worse psychological well-being, primarily through humor styles' influence on individuals' social interactions and efforts to positively reframe stressors. The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.",

  "abstract": "Effective field theories (EFTs) organize the description of complex systems into an infinite sequence of decreasing importance. Predictions are made with a finite number of terms, which induces a truncation error that is often left unquantified. We formalize the notion of EFT convergence and propose a Bayesian truncation error model for predictions that are correlated across the independent variables, e.g., energy or scattering angle. Central to our approach are Gaussian processes that encode both the naturalness and correlation structure of EFT coefficients. Our use of Gaussian processes permits efficient and accurate assessment of credible intervals, allows EFT fits to easily include correlated theory errors, and provides analytic posteriors for physical EFT-related quantities such as the expansion parameter. We demonstrate that model-checking diagnostics-applied to the case of multiple curves-are powerful tools for EFT validation. As an example, we assess a set of nucleonnucleon scattering observables in chiral EFT. In an effort to be self-contained, appendices include thorough derivations of our statistical results. Our methods are packaged in Python code, called gsum, that is available for download on GitHub.",

  "abstract": "Habitat loss and degradation affect populations in isolation while also modifying the intensity of interspecific interactions, which may be especially relevant for species of conservation concern coexisting with more common species. We explored habitat preferences and potential interspecific resource competition in the endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata). For habitat data, water quality measurements were recorded once per trapping session, while canopy cover and vegetation data were recorded once per field season. We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O-2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles ( Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species. We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences. We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles and ultimately found that all species had similar, broad diets. The inverse relationship between abundance of C. guttata and other species, paired with the overlap in dietary niche space, suggests there is potential for interspecific interactions to negatively impact the abundance of C. guttata within turtle communities on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The results of this study highlight that management efforts may need to consider that species of conservation concern coexist with more common species, especially as habitat loss decreases the breadth of habitat available.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of ownership structure on dividend policy, specifically the role of controlling shareholders in shaping dividend policy in a sample of firms that pay dividends and issue new equity simultaneously. The results show that managers in weakly governed firms are more likely to initiate customized dividends to meet outside large shareholders' needs while simultaneously using costly external capital to finance new investment projects. This paper contributes to the existing literature on agency problems by explaining why firms engage in this suboptimal dividend policy: it allows large shareholders to extract private benefits.",

This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.",

  "abstract": "Assessing adolescent sexual identity is complicated, and contemporary sexual identities are gaining greater complexity and variation. However, current measures do not capture the diversity of contemporary identities among adolescents. Thus, our study utilized a large national data set of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 years (N = 2,558) in the United States to propose a taxonomy of sexual identities among adolescents. Participants responded to a close-ended sexual identity question, followed by an open-ended qualitative question. Using the steps outlined in content analysis procedures, two researchers independently coded the open-ended responses, which were then discussed to establish consensus. Coding of open-ended responses to the sexual identity question resulted in eight categories, with more than 25% of adolescents identifying with less common sexual identity labels. We further tested differences in sexual identity among responses to the close-ended question, sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health outcomes using chi-square and analysis of variance tests. We found overall differences in sexual identification by close-ended responses, age, and assigned sex at birth. However, we did not find any difference in sexual identity by race and ethnicity or urbanicity. We also found differences in sexual identity by mental health symptoms and suicidal outcomes, especially among respondents who identified with less common sexual identity labels. Findings from our study provide cutting-edge information on sexual identities that better captures the current state of adolescent sexual identity classification in the United States. Future research should employ this taxonomy of eight sexual identity categories to collect data that reflect contemporary evidence. Public Significance Statement Findings of this study of the diverse sexual identities among adolescents suggest that, compared to adolescents reporting more common identities (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual), those reporting less common sexual identities (e.g., pansexual, queer) are at greater risk for negative mental health outcomes. Further, because these less common sexual identities are often not captured using current measures, the authors propose a more diverse categorical list of eight sexual identities that could be used by researchers to collect this important demographic information in future studies.",

  "abstract": "Perceived job insecurity is a critical job stressor that creates the conditions for negative health and performance outcomes for workers while potentially increasing health-related costs for employers. Sleep quality, an important proxy of health, has been understudied in relation to the impact of perceived job insecurity. Using job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, this study examines the association between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality while considering negative work spillover as a mediator. We expand our analysis to consider gender as a moderator of the job insecurity-sleep quality relationship, predicting the relationship will be stronger for men than for women. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample from the Midlife Development in the United States National Survey Refresher study consisting of 1031 working adults and a multi-group path analysis to test our hypotheses. Results show that negative work spillover mediates the relationship between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality. Study 2 uses a sample of 152 working adults who participated in three biweekly surveys. The mediating role of negative work spillover is replicated in Study 2. In both studies, no gender moderation is found. Theoretical and methodological contributions, limitations and future research directions are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of a corporate label change (CLC) from investors' perspective, especially based on the stakeholder approach to corporate identity. The resource-based theory has been used as a theoretical root of understanding the antecedents and consequences of brands. The authors specifically examine how two important types of firm-level heterogeneity - firm size and firm age - change shareholder reactions. In addition, the authors also test the moderating effects of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach Using Korean company data, the authors first calculate the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) with the two-day event window [-1,0]. Then, the authors test the impacts of firm size and age on CAR with ordinary least squares regressions. To understand greater dynamics, the authors also test the moderation effects of firm performance. For the robustness check, the authors test using a different event window and different measures as well. Findings The findings for South Korean companies reveal that CLC itself does not significantly affect shareholder value. However, firm size and firm age show positive and significant coefficients. This means that larger and older firms are more likely to have better investor reactions. In addition, the authors also test a moderation effect of firm performance. The result shows that the impact of firm size weakens when firms have better performance. Research limitations/implications The first limitation is the generalizability of the findings, particularly those regarding the impacts of CLC on investor reactions. A second limitation is that the authors did not consider the time gaps between CLCs. Third, there are limitations of using an event study with stock market data due to the ambiguity of the causal relationship between a firm's strategic choices and market reactions. Lastly, the authors use all CLCs except CLCs related to corporate governance (i.e. mergers and acquisitions). Practical implications Although managers expect positive relations by introducing a new corporate label, the outcomes may not be sufficient because potential losses (i.e. losing royal customers) are significant. Hence, more careful considerations are required when a manager forms a new CLC. The results provide valuable insights for the conditions when large and aged companies pursue CLCs. In addition, the needs of a CLC are increasing when a company shows underperformance. Poor performance is a trigger for introducing new strategic choices (Boeker, 1997). The finding can be another supporting material for managers to consider when they intend to perform CLCs. Originality/value The authors probe the effect of CLC on external stakeholders, particularly investor reactions. The current literature has discussed the impacts of CLC on employees, internal stakeholders, and customers, external stakeholders. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no strategy for understanding a CLC under stakeholder aspects. The authors believe that the findings contribute to the extant literature on CLC. This question is also important to a manager. Although introducing a new corporate label is a popular strategy for firms to provide corporate identity to various stakeholders, many cases have shown mixed results. This research provides evidence of what to consider when a manager makes its decision.",

  "abstract": "In Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist, Charles Brockden Brown explores foundational aesthetic complexes that inform his fitful attempts to express the emergent contours of an American poetics and politics of self-fashioning. Through the youthful figure of Carwin, Brown depicts how the nascent American artist's suffocating and repressed relationship with his patrimonial heritage provides the impetus for discovering and internalizing revolutionary, transformative, and subversive powers inherent in nature's hidden forms. Carwin's gradual, covert self-empowerment achieves expression not only through the agency of natural, local, and American forces but also through an allusive matrix connecting John Milton's A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) with William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Brown portrays Carwin's halting, and ultimately ineffectual, attempts to transform a poetics of imposture into a politics of subversion.",

In Study 1 (N = 108), self-enhancing and affiliative humor were associated fewer health difficulties and less psychological distress, mediated by reappraisal and social support, respectively. Self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, mediated by both reappraisal and social support. Social competence moderated the relation of aggressive humor with social support: Individuals high on both aggressive humor and communication difficulties reported the least support. Study 2 followed undergraduates (N = 193) over ten weeks. T1 results for psychological distress replicated Study 1. Social support and reappraisal mediated relations of humor styles with T1 distress, and social support indirectly mediated the relation of aggressive humor with increased T2 distress. Aggressive humor was associated with T1 health difficulties, and self-defeating humor predicted greater health difficulties over time. Reappraisal and social support indirectly mediated the relation of self-enhancing and affiliative humor with fewer Ti health difficulties, and social support indirectly mediated the relation of aggressive humor with increased health difficulties over time. Communication difficulties moderated the relation of aggressive humor with fewer T1 positive interactions and greater somatic symptoms over time. Relations largely held controlling for shared variance among humor styles.",

  "abstract": "The change in enthalpy of a chemical reaction conducted at constant pressure is equal to the heat of the reaction plus the nonexpansion work of the reaction, Delta H = qP + w(additional). After deriving that relationship, most general and physical chemistry textbooks set w(additional) = 0 to arrive at the claim that Delta H = q(p), and nearly all further discussion of enthalpy assumes that Delta H = q(p). Setting w(additional) = 0 is viable for spontaneous reactions, but for non-spontaneous reactions, w(additional) not equal 0 as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, Delta H # q(p) for nonspontaneous reactions. Moreover, nonexpansion work is important for many interesting and important spontaneous reactions in biology (e.g., muscular movement, nerve signal transmission) and in modern society (e.g., batteries); incorporating w(additional) into Delta H allows for a more accurate discussion of the energy flow in these reactions. In this paper, I show that Delta H not equal qp for nonspontaneous reactions, and I discuss how Delta H must be partitioned between q(p), and w(additional) for several kinds of reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, I suggest how the discussion of enthalpy could be corrected in general and physical chemistry textbooks.",

Design: Pre-posttest, repeated measures non-experimental design. Methods: A convenience sample of Chinese Americans participated in a culturally tailored nurse led AD and ACP workshop in English and Mandarin in a Chinese Community Center. Participants completed surveys before and after the workshop and at one-month follow-up. Results: Seventy-two Chinese Americans participated in this study. Most were female and born in China. Attitudes toward ADs improved after participating in the workshop and remained consistent at one-month follow-up. There was a significant positive relationship between attitudes and AD completion and ACP discussions.

In practice, however, many firms communicate their donation contributions in more ambiguous terms (e.g., descriptive quantifiers). Across three studies, the authors demonstrate when using monetary quantifiers is less beneficial, due to consumers' skepticism of firm motives. Study 1 shows that the presence of a CM promotion positively affects perceptions of price fairness. Study 2 provides evidence that donation quantifier formats operate uniquely and impact price fairness through skepticism. Finally, Study 3 demonstrates ways in which practitioners can manage consumer skepticism, which affect perceptions of price fairness and ultimately purchase intent.",

Our most striking result is that a higher CIT rate is associated with faster movement to a higher sales factor weight. Perhaps indicating that, for economic development, states use sales factor manipulation in lieu of reducing CIT rates broadly, or alternatively, that states raise sales factor weights to compensate for higher statutory CIT rates. Results also indicate that stronger growth in the CIT base and in non-corporate tax revenues hasten sales factor weight increases. Democratic control of the state government and gubernatorial election years are also important in the timing of sales factor manipulation.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resistance exercise provides an effective stimulus for improving the metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle, and the type of acute muscle contraction plays an important role in determining specific responses and adaptations. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the effect of contraction order on metabolic responses by comparing monophasic concentric and eccentric squats versus a protocol incorporating alternated concentric and eccentric repetitions. METHODS: Twelve recreationally active men (21.1 +/- 1.1yr) performed three nearly identical squat protocols on separate days. Protocols varied only with contraction-type, including 4 sets x 10 reps concentric-only (CON), eccentric-only (ECC), and BOTH which alternated 5 concentric followed by 5 eccentric reps (CON-ECC; sets 1 and 3) and vice versa (ECC-CON; sets 2 and 4). The experimental trials were performed once weekly in a randomized, counter-balanced order, and expired gases were collected using a two-way non-rebreathing mask and oxygen consump-tion quantified with indirect calorimetry. Subjects raised (CON) and lowered (ECC) the load in 2s, and all sets (2 min) and repetitions (8 s) were separated by standardized rest intervals. RESULTS: From the BOTH protocol, the increase in metabolic rate was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during squats performed with CON-ECC order (0.60 +/- 0.11 L.min(-1)) compared to ECC-CON (0.44 +/- 0.07 L.min(-1)), but excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) was opposite, with significantly greater metabolic rate during the 2-minute rest intervals after ECC-CON squats (0.46 +/- 0.09 L.min(-1)) compared to CON-ECC (0.25 +/- 0.05 L.min(-1)). Metabolic rates during and after squats were significantly greater (P <= 0.05) with CON (0.63 +/- 0.09; 0.49 +/- 0.10 L.min(-1)) compared to ECC (0.34 +/- 0.04; 0.20 +/- 0.04 L.min(-1)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data present an interesting paradigm regarding the contraction-dependent metabolic responses to monophasic resis-tance exercise and suggest a greater EPOC following concentric versus eccentric muscle actions.",

  "abstract": "In 1998, Montgomery County, Maryland adopted a local earned income tax credit (EITC) program. We use U.S Vital Statistics data covering births in Maryland from 1995 to 2004 to examine whether the local EITC impacted birth weight and the probability of low birth weight in Montgomery County. Using difference-in-differences (DD) and triple differences (DDD) strategies, we find that the Montgomery County EITC decreased the probability of low birth weight by 1.9 to 2.4 percentage points among likely eligible mothers. Using the local credit as a unique opportunity to identify EITC EITC effects within a state, these estimates contribute to a growing body of literature that finds improved birth outcomes for credit recipients.",

    "abstract": "We recently developed a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation in general effective field theories. Here we present selected results from using that framework to estimate parameters with a nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential derived using chiral effective field theory (chi EFT): the semi-local NN potential of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Meißner (EKM). There are many NN scattering data, up to high energies, and with rather small errors. Imposing a penalty for unnatural low-energy constants (LECs) therefore has a small effect on the fits, unless only a small fraction of the NN data is used in the fit. In contrast, we have found that including an estimate of higher orders in chi EFT plays an important role in robust parameter estimation. We present two case studies where our Bayesian machinery illuminates physics issues. The first involves the EKM potential at fourth order in the chi EFT expansion: the two-dimensional posterior probability density function (pdf) for the fourth-order s-wave LECs obtained from the Nijmegen PWA93 phase shifts indicates these parameters in the NN potential are degenerate. We trace this feature of the pdf to the presence of an operator in the fourth-order NN potential that vanishes on-shell. The second case study examines the stability of LEC extractions as more data at higher energies are included in the fit. We show that as long as chi EFT truncation errors are properly accounted for in the parameter estimation, the LEC values extracted using our Bayesian approach are not sensitive to the maximum energy chosen for the fit. Uncorrelated and fully correlated models for the truncation errors are compared, pointing the way to the use of Gaussian processes to more generally model the correlation structure.",

    "abstract": "Muslim women experience gendered Islamophobia because their Muslim identity is often more visible and comes to symbolize their culture. Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one's Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one's Muslim identity in public. Microaggressions and offence at Trump's proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump's statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.",

  "abstract": "Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is a dominant shrub in the warm deserts of North America and also a classic example of an autopolyploid complex. We determined ploidy levels for creosote leaves preserved in ancient packrat middens from the Peloncillo Mountains, AZ to better understand the history of ploidy race distribution along its diploid-tetraploid boundary. We also measured modem creosote ploidy level at several sites spanning the AZ-NM border to augment sampling in this large geographic area. Modem plants were mostly diploids, with tetraploids only observed in our northernmost sites. Ancient creosote from the Peloncillo middens (3170-145 cal yr BP) were all diploids. Modem creosote at the Peloncillo site is also diploid, but with significantly larger guard cells areas that may be a response to increasingly hot, dry conditions. The lack of tetraploids in the midden fossils suggests the arrival of tetraploids at their eastern margin may have occurred only recently, mirroring the late arrivals of other Sonoran Desert plants (e.g., Simmondsia chinensis) along the AZ-NM border.",

  "abstract": "Spatial memory allows animals to retain information regarding the location, distribution, and quality of feeding sites to optimize foraging decisions. Western gorillas inhabit a complex environment with spatiotemporal fluctuations of resource availability, prefer fruits when available, and travel long distances to reach them. Here, we examined movement patterns-such as linearity, distance, and speed of traveling-to assess whether gorillas optimize travel when reaching out-of-sight valued resources. Our results show that gorillas travel patterns are affected by the activity they perform next, the type of food they feed on, and their preference level to specific fruits, suggesting they are able to optimize foraging based on spatial knowledge of their resources. Additionally, gorillas left in the direction of the next resource as soon as they started traveling and decelerated before approaching food resources, as evidence that they have a representation of their exact locations. Moreover, home range familiarity did not influence gorillas' movement patterns, as travel linearity in the core and periphery did not differ, suggesting that they may not depend wholly on a network of paths to navigate their habitat. These results show some overlap with chimpanzees' spatial abilities. Differences between the two ape species exist, however, potentially reflecting more their differences in diet (degree of frugivory) rather than their cognitive abilities. Further studies should focus on determining whether gorillas are able to use shortcuts and/or approach the same goal from multiple directions to better identify the spatial abilities used by this species.",

We report an observation of a Common Tern pair usurping the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) nest and brooding the Least Tern chicks. While the Least Tern pair attempted to provide care for the chicks, the Common Terns displayed aggressive behavior and defended the nest. Though both species attempted to feed the chicks, no feeding events were observed due to harassment from the other species. Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation. We discuss the possible scenarios leading to the observed usurpation event, the possibility that usurpations are more common than previously believed, and the need for different monitoring methods to elucidate the causes of usurpations.",

  "abstract": "Early and efficient detection of rare and invasive species is critical for the effective management of their populations. Environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques have been used for monitoring soft-bodied organisms (e.g., fishes) and some invertebrates, primarily in freshwater systems, but there are limited examples of eDNA as a method for monitoring marine crustaceans. The present study evaluates the efficacy of applying eDNA methods for detecting the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in a dynamic estuarine environment, and the effect of crab life stage (sex, molt stage, ovigery, abundance) on eDNA detection rates. An initial field experiment conducted in a local salt marsh system detected no C. maenas eDNA in sediment samples associated with traps containing C. maenas. In subsequent laboratory trials, aquaria containing one or two C. maenas at different life stages (soft-shell, hard-shell, male, female, ovigerous) were evaluated in replicated treatments to test the hypothesis that C. maenas exudes eDNA at higher levels when ovigerous, soft-shell, or at higher abundances. Duplicate sediment slurry and water samples were collected from each aquarium (n = 23) prior to crab addition (T-0), and after 24 h (T-1), 4 days (T-2), and 7 days (T-3). Sediment slurry and water samples were filtered, extracted, and analyzed using a species-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. In all non-control aquaria, C. maenas eDNA was detected, but concentrations were low (<10 copies/mu L) in non-ovigerous treatments. eDNA concentrations were significantly higher in sediment slurry versus water samples for male and ovigerous treatments. Overall, concentrations increased from T-0 to T-1 but did not significantly change from T-1 through T-3. The findings from this study indicate that during most of their life cycle, C. maenas shed low levels of DNA, highlighting the importance of considering life stage and sampling methodology when using eDNA to monitor crustaceans in estuarine environments.",

  "abstract": "Social work, with its commitment to social justice, knowledge about cultural diversity, and respect for the dignity and worth of the individual, has much to contribute to the modern-day human rights debate. Many international social work scholars have articulated the view of social work as a human rights profession. The profession's presence in this arena, however, has not always been apparent. Amid increasing global tensions and domestic challenges, equipping social work students with human rights knowledge and skills is critical. The limited attention given to human rights in social work education, particularly in the United States, provides a unique opportunity to explore the human rights discourse occurring in academic circles. This paper presents a review of scholarly journal articles that explore the human rights discourse related to social work education in the United States. Upon reviewing the literature, the following categories emerged: (1) general articles on integrating human rights into social work education; (2) pedagogical frameworks, models, and examples of incorporating human rights into social work education; and (3) measures and perceptions related to assessing the integration of human rights in social work education. Findings indicate that the inclusion of human rights into social work education in the United States is in its infancy. It is recommended that social work programs in the United States be more intentional about integrating human rights content into the curricula to train culturally competent and globally minded social workers.",

In this research we find that an unfamiliar brand can successfully use an Exceptionally Strong Warranty (ESW) as a quality signal under some conditions. When used in an offer alone, ESW results in more favorable perceptions of quality than a weaker market-standard warranty provided consumers' self-assessed knowledge for the product concerned is high enough, and regardless of their objective product knowledge. However, ESW is not an effective quality signal for consumers with low levels of self-assessed product knowledge unless it is accompanied by a supporting trusted signal like Third-Party Organization Endorsement (TPOE). It appears that consumers with high self-assessed knowledge tend to accept an ESW from an unfamiliar brand heuristically whereas the signal needs assistance from a naturally trusted signal like TPOE to be effective for low knowledge consumers also.",

Our statistically rigorous analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to truncation of the xEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H I3-decay rate can only be obtained if xEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The I3-decay rate is the only one of these that yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. We find a xEFT expansion parameter of Q = 0.33 +/- 0.06 for these observables.",

PASCO scientific's smart cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for the smart cart by carrying out flyby measurements of the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil. Recently, Monteiro et al. reported a similar experiment with a single coil but with an ordinary laboratory cart, and had to use the accelerometer of a smart-phone to laboriously extract the precise position of the magnetic field sensor of the smartphone. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using the accelerometer and the concomitant laborious extraction of the position data. The eponymous smart cart broadcasts its precise location wirelessly over Bluetooth (R). In addition to the single circular coil verification of the Biot-Savart law, we also used the Helmholtz coil to generate and measure a uniform magnetic field over a wide central region.",

Using overall capital productivity as an efficiency proxy and state output share as an inequality proxy, we identify the efficiency threshold of state capital share that splits the efficiency-equality relationship between a tradeoff and nontradeoff. When state capital share is greater than the threshold (as evidenced in the case of China), lowering state capital share improves efficiency and reduces inequality. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the threshold is sensitive to capital shares in output of both sectors. A broad scope for mutual gains in efficiency and equality exists by raising the capital share in nonstate output and lowering the capital share in state output.",

Health care professionals often must help others understand the statistical basis for recommendations they make. A COVID-19 press briefing is used to illustrate the need for SKT when making high-stakes recommendations related to public health. It is conjectured that efforts to educate the public during the press briefing would have been enhanced if the presenters had deeper knowledge of the general public's common statistical thinking patterns, the typical statistics curriculum experienced by members of their audience, and contemporary tools for teaching statistics. The importance of such knowledge to support smaller-scale individual interactions is also discussed. A call for SKT-centered partnerships between educational researchers and medical researchers is made; such partnerships could be mutually beneficial to the development of both fields and to society at large.",

  "abstract": "This research investigates the software vendor-based relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk. The data is obtained from the China National Vulnerability Database of Information Security (CNNVD). At first, we use the latent class model to classify the software vendors into three categories, and then employ regression models to estimate relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk for each of the three categories of the software vendors. The results show the relationships vary across the software vendors. The findings suggest that an IT vendor should learn specific vulnerability features according to its type to effectively avoid vulnerability generation on their products.",

  "abstract": "Choosing a mate is one of the most important decisions an animal can make. The fitness consequences of mate choice have been analysed extensively, and its mechanistic bases have provided insights into how animals make such decisions. Less attention has been given to higher-level cognitive processes. The assumption that animals choose mates predictably and rationally is an important assumption in both ultimate and proximate analyses of mate choice. It is becoming clear, however, that irrational decisions and unpredictable nonlinearities often characterize mate choice. Here we review studies in which cognitive analyses seem to play an important role in the following contexts: auditory grouping; Weber's law; competitive decoys; multimodal communication; and, perceptual rescue. The sum of these studies suggest that mate choice decisions are more complex than they might seem and suggest some caution in making assumptions about evolutionary processes and simplistic mechanisms of mate choice.",

  "abstract": "Objective: To examine unique relations of three distinct dimensions of desirability of control with psychological and physical well-being and coping. Design: Study 1 (n = 122) surveyed undergraduates' response to everyday stressors, and Study 2 (n = 105) examined undergraduates' adjustment to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks at 1 and 3 months post-attack. Main outcome measures included psychological distress, perceived stress, rumination, health behaviors, alcohol use and active vs. avoidant coping. Study 1 Results: Self- and other-control were associated with active coping, whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Only relinquishing control was uniquely linked with outcomes, including worse psychological and physical well-being and alcohol use; avoidant coping mediated relations to psychological well-being. Study 2 Results: Again, self-control was associated with active coping whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Self-control was associated with enhanced psychological well-being at T1 and increases in well-being over time; by contrast, relinquishing control was associated with worse T1 psychological well-being, which was mediated by avoidant coping. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the unique contribution of each DOC dimension with outcomes. Self-control and relinquishing control showed divergent relations to psychological well-being, mediated by different coping pathways.",

  "abstract": "The positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and an employee's in-role performance is well-established, but explanations for why this effect exists are still in a nascent stage. Drawing upon leader behavioral integrity theory and job-demands resources theory, the authors explain how leader behavioral integrity facilitates employee in-role performance and the boundary conditions influencing the relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance. Using multisource data from 209 employee-manager dyads in South Korea, this paper found support for the mediating effect of coworker support in the positive relationship between leader behavior integrity and employees' in-role autonomy. Furthermore, compared to those who perceive low job autonomy, the positive indirect effect of leader behavioral integrity on in-role performance via coworker support was stronger for employees who perceive high job autonomy. The findings emphasize the importance of a leader's individual difference (i.e., leader behavioral integrity) and job resources (i.e., job autonomy) facilitating the receipt of team members' supporting behaviors which, in turn, energize employee in-role performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Most of our knowledge about the function, evolution, neurobiology and ontogeny of complex vocalizations in birds comes from previous work on male song. However, the recent increase in focus on female bird song over the last few decades has helped bridge that gap in our knowledge and has vastly changed our understanding of the function, phylogeny and evolution of bird song. Here we present evidence that female song may be modifiable based on signal function. Eastern bluebirds primarily use female song for within-pair communication with their social mate. We examined the female songs of eastern bluebirds sung during within-pair communication and compared the acoustic structure to female songs used in other contexts. Within-pair communication songs differed significantly from other female songs that we measured by six of the eight acoustic variables we measured. Additionally, we examined the song structure of within-pair communication songs at variable distances between mates and between neighbour females. Song structure did not vary over distance. However, we found significant differences between neighbouring females and the number of syllables and frequency modulations each female included in her within-pair communication songs. We propose that female songs have the potential to indicate individual identity, through acoustic structure modification. Our findings further highlight the need for additional study of female song and functional acoustic plasticity in bird song.",

  "abstract": "We face a crisis of interconnected environmental and human health problems rooted in policies, behaviors, and social inequalities that behavioral medicine can address with ecological and community-based approaches. Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine's rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.",

In this paper, we give a full description of the irreducible components of curve neighborhoods in terms of the Hecke product of (appropriate) Weyl group elements, k-strict partitions, and BC-partitions. The latter set of partitions respect the Bruhat order with inclusions.

    "abstract": "Communication systems often include a variety of components, including those that span modalities, which may facilitate detection and decision-making. For example, female tungara frogs and fringelipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male tu ' ngara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of a communication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.",

A total of 20 critical racialized incidents were reported and 6 dominant themes identified: (a) intersectionality and manifestation of power differentials; (b) personal devaluation, invalidation and/or shaming; (c) projection of racial stereotypes onto students of Color; (d) uncontested racist comments; (e) differences in communication styles and preferences; and (f) institutional devaluing of racial diversity. In contrast to previous research (Boysen, 2012; Sue, Lin, Torino, Capodilupo, & Rivera, 2009), an unexpected finding was that instructors, not students, were the most frequent perpetrators of racism in the classroom.

  "abstract": "Many problems in contemporary astrophysics-from understanding the formation of black holes to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies-rely on knowledge about binary stars. This, in turn, depends on the discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational epochs, which allows for binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through radial velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,495 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P less than or similar to few years, a less than or similar to few <CDATA <i ) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,495 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic 'discovery' threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about binary-star populations and subthreshold searches.",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurship is at the heart of new developments that often lead to the creation of new industries. This study examines the origins of the canning industry via the experiences of three of its earliest entrepreneurs: Edward Wright, William Numsen, and Thomas Kensett II. The narrative examines key aspects of the industry's context including the growth in demand for preserved foods, the resources of the Chesapeake region, and the development of food preservation technology. Using the five characteristics of entrepreneurial processes, the importance of entrepreneurs in the development of the economic growth of Baltimore's early canning industry is examined. Each founder exhibited entrepreneurial characteristics in different ways. One failed in his efforts; the other two succeeded in developing businesses that endured into the next century. The study reveals that using entrepreneurial processes does not guarantee success, and that there are various paths to success. An entrepreneurial multiplier effect was also evident in the growth of firms producing supplies and equipment for canners. Using an entrepreneurial lens offers a closer insight into the development of firms and their industries. Some remaining unanswered questions as well as avenues for future studies are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Female bird song has been underappreciated and understudied, especially in temperate species. Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.",

Selecting employees who are high on emotional intelligence (EI), and training employees in emotional competencies, may be ways to improve service quality. This meta-analysis tests the claims that EI improves service quality. The findings indicate that EI is significantly and positively related to service quality and that this relationship is stronger (1) for cultures that are short (versus long) term oriented and that are indulgent (versus restrained), and (2) for professional services and service shops than for mass services.

  "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between regulation-induced time delays and export entrepreneurship in a panel of 59 countries for the period 2006 to 2014. The paper finds robust evidence that regulations which cause lengthy time delays in moving a standard container of goods from the factory to the seaport significantly reduce export entry rate. These findings support the hypothesis that decreasing regulation-induced time delays expands export entrepreneurship by reducing the cost of exporting. Additionally, the paper finds that superior quality institutions significantly enhance the positive impact of lower regulatory time barriers on export entrepreneurship. Stronger protection of private property rights is the most important measure of institutional quality that aides the favorable impact of lower regulation-induced time barriers on export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation-induced time barriers has a positive effect on net entry rate and survival rates of export entrants, and high-quality institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive outcome.",

  "abstract": "IntroductionPrevious research has found that political discourse over proposed legislation that impacts lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ +) people serves as a distal stressor which is associated with poorer mental and physical health. This study sought to document responses to the 2020 US Presidential election among LGBTQ + people living in the USA.MethodsNineteen LGBTQ + people ages 20 to 76 (M = 47.20; SD = 17.66) living across the USA were interviewed via Zoom video conferencing software between October and early December 2020. The modal participant was female (36.8%), identified as gay or lesbian (47.3%), and White (84.2%). Interviews were coded using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith & Osborn, 2003).ResultsSeventeen codes emerged, which were grouped into three themes. Participants viewed specific political figures, namely then-President Trump and Supreme Court nominee Coney-Barrett, as symbolic of the potential loss of rights and disenfranchisement of LGBTQ + people. Participants exhibited uncertainty about the future; however, a Biden presidential win was viewed as potentially instilling complacency and leading to fracturing of the LGBTQ + community. While some participants avoided news, most were engaged with the political process as a means of coping with election uncertainty.ConclusionsThe findings have implications for better understanding the concerns of LGBTQ + folks as it relates to how they view political discourse and the future of the equality movement.Policy ImplicationsPolicies which beneficially impact and engage a diverse range of LGBTQ + people would facilitate mobilization of LGBTQ + political communities.",

  "abstract": "This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance-low acquisition, (II) low alliance-high acquisition, (III) high alliance-low acquisition, (IV) high alliance-high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance-very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Mangroves shelter coastlines during hazardous storm events with coastal communities experiencing mangrove deforestation are increasingly vulnerable to economic damages resulting from cyclones. To date, the benefits of mangroves in terms of protecting coastal areas have been estimated only through individual case studies of specific regions or countries. Using spatially referenced data and statistical methods, we track from 2000 to 2012 the impact of cyclones on economic activity in coastal regions inhabited by nearly 2,000 tropical and subtropical communities across 23 major mangrove-holding countries. We use nighttime luminosity to represent temporal trends in coastal economic activity and find that direct cyclone exposure typically results in permanent loss of 5.4-6.7 mo for a community with an average mangrove extent (6.3 m per meter of coastline); whereas, a community with more extensive mangroves (25.6 m per meter of coastline) experiences a loss equivalent to 2.6-5.5 mo. These results suggest that mangrove restoration efforts for protective benefits may be more cost effective, and mangrove deforestation more damaging, than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) requires the preservation and restoration of forests in riparian preservation areas (RPAs). The total area in RPAs and the impacts of changes in the BFC on RPA requirements are uncertain due to lack of clarity about how RPAs are defined in practice. We reconstruct the history of the RPA rule, use a recent cadastral database (CAR) of the state of Rondonia to quantify the area of RPA by stream size and to document the impact of the 2012 changes in RPA requirements, and review the literature on hydrological ecosystem services (HES) in light of RPA rules. We find that most (64%) of the area in RPAs in the state of Rondonia was illegally deforested by 2017, and the 2012 regulations require restoration of only half of that cleared area. Most of the RPA is located along small streams (< 10 m wide) that were typically missing in previous assessments. As of 2017, 66% of the RPA along small streams was deforested, while most (70-95%) RPA along large streams (> 200 m wide) was forested. Current restoration requirements (5 m regardless of stream width) for very small properties (< 60 ha) are likely inadequate to restore HES. Preservation of forest along large streams remains important, but policy and management should also emphasize the preservation and restoration of forest along small streams because they account for most of the riparian preservation area, with important implications for humans and ecosystems.",

We engage the theoretical concept of cultural chronotopes (Agha, 2007a) to demonstrate how spatially and temporally entwined experiences of nostalgia and modernity are produced in South Delhi's commercial LL, and show how such positioning serves to compress or flatten such experiences for ready consumption (Kockelman, 2006). Focusing on particularized chronotopes tied to a privileged and elite experience, imagination and aspiration, we highlight how discourses of the ` ideal' are reproduced and positioned as visceral through specific references or semiotic arrangements. In so doing, we discuss the quantification of experience executed by these signs in commodifying the visceral, and the problematic way these instances propagate an idealized, sanitized and simplified understanding of Indian rural communities, Indian history and Indian traditional practices.",

  "abstract": "Disorders of the nervous system (NS) impact millions of adults, worldwide, as a consequence of traumatic injury, genetic illness, or chronic health conditions. Contemporary studies have begun to incorporate neuroglia into emerging NS therapies to harness the regenerative potential of glial-mediated synapses in the brain and spinal cord. However, the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds neuroglia and interfaces with their associated synapses remains only partially explored. The flow of CSF within subarachnoid spaces (SAS) circulates essential polypeptides, metabolites, and growth factors that directly impact neural response and recovery via signaling with healthy glia. Despite the availability of artificial CSF solutions used in neurosurgery and NS treatments, tissue engineering projects continue to use cell culture media, such as Neurobasal (NB) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), for development and characterization of many transplantable cells, matrixes, and integrated cellular systems. The current study examined in vitro behaviors of glial Schwann cells (ShC) and spinal cord explants (SCE) within a CSF replacement solution, Elliott's B Solution (EBS), used widely in the treatment of NS disorders. Our tests used EBS to create defined chemical microenvironments of extracellular factors within a glial line (gLL) microfluidic device, previously described by our group. The gLL is comparable in scale to the in vivo SAS that envelopes endogenous CSF and enables molecular transport via mechanisms of convective diffusion. Our results illustrate that EBS solutions facilitate ShC survival, morphology, and proliferation similar to those measured in traditional DMEM, and additionally support glial chemotactic behaviors in response to brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). Our data indicates that ShC undergo significant chemotaxis toward high and low concentration gradients of BDNF with statistical differences between gradients formed within diluents of EBS and DMEM solutions. Moreover, SCE cultured with EBS solutions facilitated measurement of neurite explant extension commensurate with reported in vivo measurements. This data highlights the translational significance and advantages of incorporating CSF replacement fluids to interrogate cellular behaviors and advance regenerative NS therapies.",

  "abstract": "Effects of a 12-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness: a randomized controlled trial. Arterial stiffness is an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Some reports indicate that resistance training increases indices of arterial stiffness, whereas others report no association. This study sought to determine the association between 2 common resistance training models and indices of arterial stiffness. We recruited 30 male, untrained subjects (18-30 years) and randomized them into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON, n = 10), high-intensity resistance exercise (HI, n = 10), and high-volume resistance exercise (HV, n = 10). Subjects randomized to the resistance training groups were required to perform whole-body strength training exercises 3-5 days a week for 12 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50-70% of 1RM) for the HV group. Anthropometry, carotid artery diameters, peripheral and central blood pressure, and maximal dynamic strength were measured before and after the 12-week study period. Subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet and avoid aerobic exercise during the study. After the intervention, both the HI and HV groups increased their maximal strength on the back squat, bench press, and seated row (all p < 0.05). However, there were no changes in arterial stiffness indices between the groups. Using a randomized controlled trial with validated measurements of arterial stiffness, chronic resistance training does not appear to influence central arterial stiffness, regardless of training volume and load.",

Since the formation of the American Psychological Association Division 27: Community Psychology in 1966, now SCRA, 54 people have served in the Presidential role. Presidential leaders' annual addresses both reflect the current state of the field and have the ability to shape the future of both SCRA as an organization and community psychology as a discipline given their positions as leaders. This commentary explores the trajectory of SCRA as an organization via 33 available presidential addresses, 28 of which were published in the American Journal of Community Psychology (AJCP). Using thematic analysis and drawing on both dialectical and life cycle organizational processes, three periods of SCRA and community psychology more broadly were identified: defining community psychology, applying community psychology, and re-imagining community psychology. Themes speak to tensions between the ideals of the society and the work of the society. We conclude by offering a series of questions for consideration as SCRA positions itself for the future.

Using 200-m transacts and dung-baited pitfall traps. we compared the dung beetle communities on 19 cattle farms in Maryland, USA where pests and!or parasites were controlled with chemicals (CU. n = 9 farms) or where no chemicals were used (NCU, n = 10 farms). Traps were baited once a month with fresh cattle dung from each location. We collected a total of 31 species comprising 12,380 dung beetle specimens. The five most abundant species, Onthophagus taunts (Schreber), Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold, Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), Blackhurneus stercomsus (Melsheimer), and Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar). accounted for 85% of the total individuals sampled. No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms. Present-day management practices implement a broad spectrum of chemical usage. Our work examines this variability to facilitate the understanding of factors currently affecting the biodiversity and abundance of beneficial dung beetles.",

  "abstract": "This article presents some features, potentials, limitations, and bibliographies of the intersection of postcolonialism, postsecularism, and literary studies. It examines literatures, cultures, religions, indigenous beliefs and practices, and political imaginaries from Africa, Europe, and South Asia. The religions discussed include Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. The article shows how the institutional and discursive emergence of postcolonial postsecularism, including its intersection with literary studies, can draw lessons from similarly contestatory fields of study, such as postcolonial theory, postcolonial feminism, and intersectional feminism. The article includes bibliographies of literary works that address secularism and postsecularism, including their intersection with postcoloniality.",

  "abstract": "The work of teaching includes many in-the-moment decisions for teachers to make. In this study, we focused on the decisions prospective teachers made within the elementary context specific to shared teaching practice in mathematics and science instruction - elicit and use evidence of student thinking. Within a qualitative multisite case study, we analyzed data for how PTs took up student thinking within instructional decisions, and the nature of responsive moves enacted within an animated context once student thinking had been elicited. Findings reveal PTs were responsive to elicited student thinking. Most commonly, PTs' instructional decisions involved asking additional questions or inviting students to test their ideas. However, PTs' pedagogical moves varied across mathematics and science disciplines. Our findings guide teacher educators to focus on what moves best support PTs' development to use evidence of student thinking across disciplines in the elementary classroom. The consistency of asking questions within mathematics and science begins to inform the quest for shared core practices. Results highlight the benefit of using technology (i.e. animations) as a tool to support PTs' learning of instructional decisions and pedagogical moves to uncover the nuances of the teaching practice elicit and use evidence of student thinking.",

  "abstract": "Binary success/failure data is an important type of data which occurs in a wide range of fields and application domains. We examine a new overdispersed statistical distribution for this type of data which is particularly suited to 'big data' contexts. The distribution, called the tilted beta-binomial distribution, has a number of attractive properties with regard to tractability and interpretability. We apply the distribution to the analysis of Maryland population data from the 2010 U.S. Census. We find the tilted beta-binomial distribution provides a superior fit compared to the beta-binomial distribution in the current data set and provides new options for modeling success/failure data. In addition to addressing overdispersion, the distribution has implications for generating new insights by revealing underlying latent subgroups in data.",

    "abstract": "Sexual minority people in the United States are less likely to have access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.",

  "abstract": "This paper explores top-down, enacted, institutional pushbacks to supermobility and superdiversity in the under-examined arena of academia using emerging frameworks in political economy and the geography of mobility. Zooming in on the discoursal framings of a recent year of job advertisements on a popular, open-source forum for linguists supplemented with qualitatively and quantitatively sourced data from international, national, and local institutional contexts, the paper examines how macrocontextual pushes toward political populism combined with a synchronous tightening of job markets in academia have enacted a plethora of labels for temporary work in lieu of permanent academic positions-now, increasingly the only option for job seekers in a hypercompetitive academic market. In this manufacturing of euphemization discourse, we witness the invention of novel, microlinguistically rendered lexicalizations of semiotic redundancy in academic capitalism's own obfuscation of profit margins, and a concomitant manufacturing of a new discourse of rationality in which floating semiotic signifiers at multiple scales deploy nationality-criteria to justify ethnic exclusion and/or entry into academic space. More crucially, in these commonsensical framings, we encounter both causation and consequence of newly enacted barriers to transnational mobility. In challenging the myth of porous borders for mobile professionals in the post-global moment, these emerging linguistic signifiers point to the ascendancy of a new public affectivity on display in intellectual spheres and a saturation of sentiment toward illiberality.",

  "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is estimated to affect 50% of diabetic patients. Although DPN is highly prevalent, molecular mechanisms remain unknown and treatment is limited to pain relief and glycemic control. We provide a novel model of acute DPN in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. Beginning 5 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish expressing nitroreductase in their pancreatic beta-cells were treated with metronidazole (MTZ) for 48 h and checked for beta-cell ablation 7 dpf. In experimental design, this was meant to serve as proof of concept that beta-cell ablation and hyperglycemia are possible at this time point, but we were surprised to find changes in both sensory and motor nerve components. Compared with controls, neurod(+) sensory neurons were often observed outside the dorsal root ganglia in MTZ-treated fish. Fewer motor nerves were properly ensheathed by nkx2.2a(+) perineurial cells, and tight junctions were disrupted along the motor nerve in MTZ-treated fish compared with controls. Not surprisingly, the motor axons of the MTZ-treated group were defasciculated compared with the control group, myelination was attenuated, and there was a subtle difference in Schwann cell number between the MTZ-treated and control group. All structural changes occurred in the absence of behavioral changes in the larvae at this time point, suggesting that peripheral nerves are influenced by acute hyperglycemia before becoming symptomatic. Moving forward, this novel animal model of DPN will allow us to access the molecular mechanisms associated with the acute changes in the hyperglycemic peripheral nervous system, which may help direct therapeutic approaches.",

We analyzed Wisconsin school-leader application data by gender, seeking to understand whether or not men and women present themselves differently through language in the initial application phase. Using an electronic linguistic analysis tool (Docuscope), we identified patterns in the writing samples from 2,061 applicants and applied critical discourse analysis to determine the role gender plays in candidates' portrayals of themselves. This mixed-methods approach revealed that language use differs significantly between male and female applicants. Notably, linguistic variables common in female candidates' writing tend to focus on elaborating ideas and using compare/contrast techniques to describe beliefs. Male applicants' language is often more formal and relies heavily on passive voice. Our findings raise questions as to whether candidates may be selected because of an unconscious preference for language patterns commonly used by females or males.",

  "abstract": "Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg is an economically important tree species that produce the highly prized agarwood. In recent years, agarwood production has been seriously threatened by the outbreak of Heortia vitessoides Moore, a leaf-eating pest that shows gregariousness during the larval stage. However, little attention has been paid to the aggregation behavior of H. vitessoides larvae. In the present study, we collected 102 cohorts of H. vitessoides larvae (13,173 individuals in total) in the wild; 54 cohorts were comprised of the same-instar larvae, and 48 cohorts were comprised of larvae with different developmental stages (instars). In general, young larvae (<third instar) tended to form large aggregations, whereas older-instar larvae were either solitary or formed small aggregations. Laboratory studies showed a strong aggregation tendency in the newly hatched and second-instar larvae of H. vitessoides, whenever the individuals originated from the same or different sibling cohorts. In addition, all newly hatched larvae died within two days after they were isolated. When newly hatched larvae were initially assigned in 10-larvae cohorts (containing sibling individuals) or 20-larvae cohorts (either containing individuals originating from the same or different sibling cohorts), their larval survivorship, duration of larval stage, and adult emergence were not significantly different. Interestingly, combining avermectin-treated larvae (donors) with untreated ones (receptors) significantly decreased larval survivorship and adult emergence of receptors, indicating a horizontal transfer of avermectin among H. vitessoides larvae. This study enhances our understanding of the population ecology of H. vitessoides, and may bring novel insights into the management strategies against this pest.",

  "abstract": "Habitats with spatial variation in food availability, predation risk, and hunting pressure allow us to study how animals resolve the trade-off between food searching and predator avoidance. We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow-breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.",

  "abstract": "Sex-biased dispersal is common in many animals, with male-biased dispersal often found in studies of mammals and reptiles, including interpretations of spatial genetic structure, ostensibly as a result of male-male competition and a lack of male parental care. Few studies of sex-biased dispersal have been conducted in turtles, but a handful of studies, in saltwater turtles and in terrestrial turtles, have detected male-biased dispersal as expected. We tested for sex-biased dispersal in the endangered freshwater turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) by investigating fine-scale genetic spatial structure of males and females. We found significant spatial genetic structure in both sexes, but the patterns mimicked each other. Both males and females typically had higher than expected relatedness at distances < 25 km, and in many distance classes greater than 25 km, less than expected relatedness. Similar patterns were apparent whether we used only loci in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (n = 7) or also included loci with potential null alleles (n = 5). We conclude that, contrary to expectations, sex-biased dispersal is not occurring in this species, possibly related to the reverse sexual dimorphism in this species, with females having brighter colors. We did, however, detect significant spatial genetic structure in males and females, separate and combined, showing philopatry within a genetic patch size of C. guttata, which is concerning for an endangered species whose populations are often separated by distances greater than the genetic patch size.",

Thus, the ability to anticipate seasonal rainfall shortages, such as the 2015 drought, is particularly important, yet few reliable tools exist for this purpose. Consequently, interpolated surface precipitation observations from the Daymet archive are summarized on daily, annual, and seasonal time scales and compared to the host thermodynamic environment as characterized by the Galvez-Davison index (GDI), a convective potential parameter designed specifically for the tropics. Complementing the Daymet precipitation totals, >= 1.1 million WSR-88D volume scans between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed for echo tops >= 10 000 ft (similar to 3 km) to establish a radar-inferred precipitation activity database for Puerto Rico. The 15-yr record reveals that the GDI outperforms several midlatitude-centric thermodynamic indices, explaining roughly 25% of daily 3-km echo top (ET) activity during each of Puerto Rico's primary seasons. In contrast, neither mean-layer CAPE, the K index, nor total totals explain more than 11% during any season. When aggregated to the seasonal level, the GDI strongly relates to 3-km ET (R-2 = 0.65) and Daymet precipitation totals (R-2 = 0.82) during the early rainfall season (ERS; April-July), with correlations weaker outside of this period. The 4-month ERS explains 51% (41%) of the variability to Puerto Rico's annual rainfall during exceptionally wet (dry) years. These findings are valuable for climate downscaling studies predicting Puerto Rico's hydroclimate in future atmospheric states, and they could potentially be adapted for operational seasonal precipitation forecasting.",

  "abstract": "We used compound-specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids (AAs) to determine the biosynthetic source of AAs in fish from major tributaries to California's Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta (i.e., the Sacramento, Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers). Using samples collected in winter and spring between 2016 and 2019, we confirmed that algae are a critical component of floodplain food webs in California's Central Valley. Results from bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in producers and consumers were adequate to characterize a general trophic structure and identify potential upstream and downstream migration into our study site by American shad Alosa sapidissima and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, respectively. However, owing to overlap and variability in source isotope compositions, our bulk data were unsuitable for conventional bulk isotope mixing models. Our results from compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of AAs clearly indicate that algae are important sources of organic matter to fish of conservation concern, such as Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in California's Central Valley. However, algae were not the exclusive source of energy to metazoan food webs. We also revealed that other sources of AAs, such as bacteria, fungi and higher plants, contributed to fish as well. While consistent with the well-supported notion that algae are critical to aquatic food webs, our results highlight the possibility that detrital subsidies might intermittently support metazoan food webs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose - The authors extend the recent research using the risk component of human resource's (HR's) compensation plans to examine the effects of risk components on two strategic outcomes: within-firm temporal change, or strategic variation, and firm strategic divergence from the industry, or strategic deviation. In addition, the authors examine the role of previous financial performance as a boundary moderator condition of the effects of risk components in the compensation plan and firm strategic outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - To examine the effects of low- and high-risk components of executive compensation on strategic variation and deviation over time, the authors collected data from 2,510 companies listed in the Standard and Poor's 500 index in a panel data format of a 12-year period. The authors gathered financial and other firm-level data from COMPUSTAT, and executive compensation and executive-level data from ExecuComp. Findings - The findings support the main effects of risk components on strategic change, while both high- and low-risk components act on strategic deviation contingent on the moderating role of total shareholder return (TSR). In the theoretical framework, the authors test the moderating role of total shareholder return (TSR) as a boundary condition of the effects of risk components in the compensation plan. In doing so, the authors provide a fine-grained understanding of the influence of compensation plan risk components on outcomes proximal to executives, such as the maintenance of the status quo and the search for financial gains. Research limitations/implications - New studies can explore a three-way moderating effect on performance indicators, such as TSR, Tobin's Q and return on asset. The authors addressed this limitation and did a comparative analysis, but the authors did not include additional moderating mechanisms in these interactive effects. Practical implications - By disaggregating the executive's compensation based on the risk components, boards of directors can mitigate any possible unwanted biases in the relationship between principal and agent. Originality/value - By considering the influence of both low- and high-risk components of compensation plans on strategic outcomes -instead of firm performance - this study expands strategy literature supporting the influence of compensation schema on a firm's outcomes. This path is new because it offers a moderating perspective to understand the strategic deviations and changes that chief executive officers imprint in their firms.",

    "abstract": "Because nursing students do not always have opportunities to interact with individuals with mental illness due to various factors such as limited clinical sites, an innovative teaching strategy was developed. Method: A plan was developed to collaborate with the theater department to offer undergraduate theater students an opportunity to practice acting skills while taking an independent study. These theater students, trained as standardized patients ( SPs), engaged with senior nursing students enrolled in a psychiatric mental health nursing clinical course in a baccalaureate program. Results: This process has been successfully implemented for the past 2 years. With 10 theater students completing the independent study and 180 nursing students engaging in interactions with SPs, improvements in communication skills for nursing students have been seen. Conclusion: Because this is a pilot project, additional research should be conducted to further explore the effectiveness of learning for both nursing and theater students.",

  "abstract": "Science should provide students an accurate and contemporary education on genetic influence, particularly how it impacts trait variability and developmental norms. Stories involving familial, racial, and sexual differences routinely appear in the popular media and sales of over-the-counter genetic tests are mounting. Unfortunately, research suggests genetic curricula in secondary education and university courses have little impact on genetic literacy; instead they appear to amplify genetic essentialism. This position paper reports on genetic essentialism, the impact of three components of science education (teachers, students, curriculum), and critiques existing genetic lessons in two prevalent scientific disciplines, biology and psychology. Two entrenched 19th century genetic paradigms (e.g., Mendelian inheritance and behavioral genetics) are specifically examined. The paper closes with specific recommendations for improving students' genetic literacy including important contemporary genetic science (e.g., epigenetics) and instructional approaches (e.g., learning progression, refutational teaching).",

    "abstract": "A growing literature highlights the benefits of playing the classic board game Diplomacy in international relations (IR) courses. But how exactly can it help students to learn not only about different IR theories, but also about what it means to use a theory in the first place? To address this question, I highlight my experiences overseeing the game during the first 2 weeks of seven introductory IR classes. Drawing from debriefing worksheets that 151 students completed after playing it, I examine whether they (1) made (implicit) connections to various theoretical perspectives and (2) developed a critical appreciation of theoretical abstraction and simplification. I find that the game's social and collaborative components lend themselves to theories beyond neorealism. More importantly, I show that by modeling rather than replicating world politics, Diplomacy introduces students to a counterintuitive idea: that theories can reveal things about reality even as they distort and omit parts of it. Moreover, having students reflect on the game's limitations encourages them to fill in the gaps, anticipate topics covered throughout the semester, and recognize the challenges of putting theories into practice.",

  "abstract": "Despite the benefits of using smart speakers, serious privacy concerns have been raised, particularly due to their constantly listening microphones. Given the mixture of the advantages and risks deciding whether to use them is not an easy matter, casting a doubt about sustainable growth and development of smart speakers. Using a sample of 559 users in South Korea and the U.S., we empirically investigated the dilemma of users seeking to adopt smart speakers. The results revealed users' perceived usefulness and enjoyment positively influenced the intention to adopt smart speakers. No direct effect of perceived ease of use was found but this effect was completely mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment was found to be twice as strong as perceived usefulness in determining the usage intention, confirming the hedonic aspect of smart speakers. Conversely, perceived privacy risks were shown to be a significant negative factor. This negative impact was significantly stronger in the U.S. than in South Korea. We could infer that the more mature the stage of acceptance of smart speakers, the greater the sensitivity of users to privacy risks. Lastly, in the South Korean sample, we found that the perceived usefulness could reduce the negative impact of perceived risks on the intention. to adopt smart speakers.",

  "abstract": "Deforestation and global climate change are predicted to affect precipitation and agricultural productivity in the Amazon. Anecdotal evidence suggests that farmers are already being affected by changes in the timing and amount of precipitation, but there is little quantitative evidence on the mechanism by which precipitation affects production. This paper uses an innovative application of remote sensing and meteorological data to separate rainfall into green water (soil moisture that contributes to plant water use) and blue water (surface water), to estimate the impact of these water sources on the production and production efficiency of dairy in a mature colonization zone of the Brazilian Amazon. This approach allows us to draw inferences about different pathways through the precipitation-production causal chain and to link changes in precipitation with impacts on farm profits and welfare. We find that production and production efficiency are affected by green and blue water and that reductions in rainfall will have negative impacts that may disproportionally impact the poor. Our methods and results are informative to economists interested in this relatively new application of remote sensing data, to geographers interested in identifying the role of green and blue water in agricultural production, and more generally to researchers interested in the impacts of rainfall and water availability on small-scale producers in the Brazilian Amazon.

  "abstract": "Amphibian populations are being threatened by human related activities including the spread of the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and urbanization. With growing losses in global amphibian biodiversity, it is essential to document how amphibian populations are responding to rapid environmental changes. While most evolutionary processes, e.g. changes in allelic frequencies, may be too slow to allow adequate response to environmental changes, epigenetic modifications can rapidly translate environmental changes into adaptive phenotypic responses. Epigenetic modifications come in multiple, non-exclusive forms, the most notable being DNA methylation. Here we sought to examine variation in the frequency of DNA methylation among four tungara frog populations distributed across Gamboa, Panama; which vary in both their level of fungal presence/prevalence and urbanization. DNA samples were collected from amplexed (male-female) pairs and frequency of DNA methylation was analyzed using a methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism protocol. We found significant variation in DNA methylation among populations, and correlations between Bd infection status and methylation patterns. Urbanization, however, had no influences on the frequency of DNA methylation. These data suggest epigenetic modifications are substantially flexible across fine-scale, environmental gradients and there appears to be possible biologically relevant links between DNA methylation and Bd infection status. Our results provide a basis for future work investigating the causal role epigenetics have in mediating phenotypic response to human-induced, environmental changes.",

  "abstract": "Landscape context is integral to population ecology, affecting a range of life history parameters, yet very little is known about how landscape structure influences many taxa. We sampled wetlands at 531 sites across 16 states in the eastern U.S. to examine the influence of landscape heterogeneity and anthropogenic land use on the relative abundance of freshwater turtles, one of the most endangered vertebrate clades in the world. Specifically, we aimed to understand how two components of landscape structure - compositional heterogeneity (wetland diversity) and configurational heterogeneity (wetland aggregation) - influence turtles with varying life history traits. Our results suggest that wetland configuration can modulate the relationship between relative abundance and anthropogenic land use. For example, spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) was negatively associated with hay/ pasture cover when wetlands were less aggregated, but this relationship subsided as aggregation increased. Notably, the way wetland aggregation modulated land use relationships varied across species. These results suggest that some anthropogenic cover types are not strictly positive or negative for certain species, but are instead context-dependent. Relative abundance also generally increased with higher wetland diversity, indicating the potential importance of landscape supplementation for turtles. We report a range of responses to roads that did not strictly correspond with well-established predictions related to body size and terrestrial activity patterns, including positive associations for certain species. Overall, our study supports the use of context-driven approaches to land use-related conservation and management decisions rather than blanket prescriptions, and further emphasizes that effective conservation of freshwater systems requires a landscape-level perspective.",
