AB In The Foundling (1833), Charlotte Bronte introduces Finic as a 'deaf-mute' dwarf whose body acts as a microcosm of nineteenth-century views on disability and race. Influenced by Sir Walter Scott's The Black Dwarf, Charlotte Bronte renders her dwarf deaf, and then in A Leaf from an Unopened Volume (1834) she links his disabilities to miscegenation. Whereas Finic's disabled body is portrayed as abject, Charlotte Bronte elevates other physical disabilities, such as the storyteller's club feet, for his disability connects him to Byron and Scott. Representations of disability in Charlotte Bronte's juvenilia also inform her later portrayals of disability in Jane Eyre and Villette.
