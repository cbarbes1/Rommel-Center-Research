AB Olcegepant is one of the most potent and selective small molecule CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine headaches. Herein, we describe a new and efficient synthesis of the key piperidinyl dihydro-quinazolinone (PDQ) fragment of olcegepant. PDQ plays a key role in the activity of CGRP antagonists. Primary improvements over existing methods include a high-yielding reductive amination step, greater overall yield, and operational simplicity. Coupling of PDQ to a D-tyrosine derivative effectively produced over one half of the total molecular structure of olcegepant. A unique tandem deprotection-nucleophilic addition sequence was also applied to the coupling of Fmoc-PDQ with phenyl isocyanate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
