AB The intersection of ethics and diversity is central to our profession-yet it remains critically unexamined. This article seeks to fill this gap by suggesting the use of a new ethical deliberation heuristic: intersectional ethics. Grounded in intersectionality as a social theory and anti-oppressive practice, intersectional ethics utilizes six heuristic questions to consider positionality, social identity categories, dominant and non-dominant moral theories, professional mandates, and power. These questions are incremental and cumulative in nature; they are meant to engage and support anti-oppressive ethics, and to promote critical inquiry and reflexivity. Specific recommendations-including modules-are made for integrating the heuristic in social work ethics curriculum.
