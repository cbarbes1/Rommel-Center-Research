AB ObjectiveTo understand college students' perceptions and understanding of wellness.ParticipantsA convenience sample of 20 undergraduate students (age 20.6 +/- 2.2 years) at a private liberal arts university in Southern California who recently completed a general education health and wellness course.MethodFive focus group sessions were conducted to explore perceptions of wellness among undergraduate college students. Data was analyzed, themed, and coded.ResultsA thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants' understanding of wellness.ConclusionsThe importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.
