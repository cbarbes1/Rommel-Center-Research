AB Background: The process of advance care planning (ACP) encompasses learning about and planning for end-of-life (EOL) decisions, documenting preferences through legal forms known as Advance Directives (ADs), and having discussions with loved ones to share these preferences. While most ethnic minority groups have low ACP engagement and AD completion rates, Chinese Americans face additional challenges related to cultural beliefs and ACP.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of a culturally tailored nurse-driven educational intervention on the relationship between attitudes toward ADs and AD completion and ACP discussions.
   Design: Pre-posttest, repeated measures non-experimental design.
   Methods: A convenience sample of Chinese Americans participated in a culturally tailored nurse led AD and ACP workshop in English and Mandarin in a Chinese Community Center. Participants completed surveys before and after the workshop and at one-month follow-up.
   Results: Seventy-two Chinese Americans participated in this study. Most were female and born in China. Attitudes toward ADs improved after participating in the workshop and remained consistent at one-month follow-up. There was a significant positive relationship between attitudes and AD completion and ACP discussions.
   Conclusions: Nurse-driven interventions improved engagement in the ACP process in Chinese Americans, a population thought to be averse to discussing death and dying and one with lower than average AD completion rates. Using culturally tailored interventions improves engagement in the ACP process.
