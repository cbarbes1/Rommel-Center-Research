AB Heart failure (HF) contributes to the highest frequency of 30-day hospital readmissions out of all causes, raising the already significant risk for adverse outcomes and costs. This quality improvement project sought to determine if 60 minutes of standardized inpatient education and scripted telephone followup, administered by staff nurses trained in HF, could reduce 30-day hospital readmissions, thus improving outcomes and self-management in this population.
