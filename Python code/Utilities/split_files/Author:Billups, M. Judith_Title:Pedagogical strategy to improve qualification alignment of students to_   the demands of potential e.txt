AB Bridging the gap between skills potential employers are seeking and skills graduates possess is relevant to Marketing Educators as they constantly search for strategies to improve the professional preparation they provide their undergraduate students. This research addresses this gap by providing one pedagogical strategy for use by educators. Researchers and Practitioners alike can benefit from and build on this research by continuing to search for and study additional strategies that may continue to bridge and eventually close the gap between skills sought and those possessed by students.
