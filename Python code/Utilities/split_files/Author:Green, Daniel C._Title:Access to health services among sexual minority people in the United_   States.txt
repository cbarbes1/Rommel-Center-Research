AB Sexual minority people in the United States are less likely to have access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.
