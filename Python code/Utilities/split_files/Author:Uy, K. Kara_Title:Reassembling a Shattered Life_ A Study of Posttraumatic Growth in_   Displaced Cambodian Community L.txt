AB The present study explored the concept of posttraumatic growth (PTG) and transformation among 12 Cambodian community leaders who are survivors of the Khmer Rouge genocide. Based on a phenomenological qualitative paradigm, this study used the conceptual models of PTG to explore coping, meaning making, and positive growth as both a process and an outcome. Four core themes emerged for the PTG process: (a) separation, loss, enslavement, and other dehumanizing experiences, (b) distress and psychological responses to trauma, (c) methods of coping used to manage debilitating distress, and (d) process of healing and meaning making. Five core themes emerged for the PTG outcome: (a) gratitude and greater appreciation of life, (b) new priorities and goals, (c) importance of family and interpersonal relationships, (d) increased personal strength, and (e) effective leadership. Principal findings in this study highlighted the importance of trauma disclosure (e.g., sharing traumatic experiences through writing, conversations, public speaking, etc.), the reconstruction of trauma narrative, religious coping, and community activism as the foundation of recovery and growth. Findings also suggest that these factors greatly influence the participants' posttraumatic outcomes, particularly in positive changes related to priorities and goals, interpersonal relationships, personal strength, and leadership effectiveness. Theoretical, societal, and clinical implications of findings as well as future directions are discussed.
