ID STANDARDIZED PATIENTS; STUDENTS
AB Caring for individuals with mental illness requires a core set of skills: knowledge of various disorders; therapeutic communication; collaboration with the multidisciplinary team; proficiency as an advocate whether for individuals, families, groups, or populations; and conflict management. In the current study, students completed toolkits with standardized patient experiences (SPEs) to practice core skill sets. Growth occurred in students' therapeutic communication and their ability to care for standardized or simulated patients with complex mental health issues. Proficiency in interprofessional collaboration, advocacy, and conflict management was also noted. Providing students with opportunities to apply leadership skills to care for individuals with complex mental illness may not always be possible in "real world" settings. Use of SPEs and toolkit activities can bridge the gap between classroom/clinical and real world settings and were highly effective in helping students meet core skill sets in mental health settings.
