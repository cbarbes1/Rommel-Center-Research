AB For primitive nontrivial Dirichlet characters chi(1) and chi(2), we study the weight zero newform Eisenstein series E-chi 1, (chi 2) (z, s) at s = 1. The holomorphic part of this function has a transformation rule that we express in finite terms as a generalized Dedekind sum. This gives rise to the explicit construction (in finite terms) of elements of H-1(Gamma(0)(N),C). We also give a short proof of the reciprocity formula for this Dedekind sum.
