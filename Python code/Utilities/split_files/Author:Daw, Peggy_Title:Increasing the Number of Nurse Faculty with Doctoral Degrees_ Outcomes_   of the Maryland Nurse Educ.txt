AB The nursing faculty shortage worsens the nursing shortage.
   The Nurse Educator Doctoral Grants for Practice and Dissertation Research (NEDG) program was launched in 2012 to expedite doctoral degree completion and reduce personal debt for full-time nurse faculty in Maryland.
   The program provided financial incentives to retain and develop a cadre of nursing faculty with terminal degrees.
   The NEDG program met its goals of increasing the number of doctorally prepared faculty in Maryland and retaining them in teaching positions.
   It is highly regarded by awardees and clearly influential in facilitating degree completion.
