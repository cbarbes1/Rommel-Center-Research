AB This paper examines the impact of startup regulations and institutional quality on the level of new business activity in a panel of 119 countries between 2001 and 2012. We find robust evidence that new business creation is significantly lower in countries with excessive barriers to entry, a lack of high-quality governmental institutions, or both. Specifically, increasing by one, the number of steps required to start a new business, reduces entrepreneurial activity between 3 and 7%. Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in the overall average level of institutional quality is associated with a 34% increase in new business activity.
