AB Background: Advocacy is widely recognized as a nursing responsibility. Speaking up, a form of advocacy, is known to benefit patient safety and quality of care yet research shows that nurses are hesitant to speak up and face multiple barriers when deciding to do so. Method: A toolkit that included web-based learning modules and simulation experience with a standardized patient was developed to enhance advocacy skills in baccalaureate nursing students. Student perceptions of the efficacy of this approach were used to revise and improve toolkit materials. Results: There were 131 participants over four semesters. Students reported the toolkit helped them understand how to use advocacy skills (87%), allowed them to use critical thinking (97%), and practice advocacy (94%). Conclusion: Educational experiences like this promote development of students' advocacy skills in a safe environment and can be used to bridge the gap between expectation and practice.
