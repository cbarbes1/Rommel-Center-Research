AB Despite LGBTQ + serving organizations being bastions of education, support, and advocacy for LGBTQ + communities, there is a dearth of work on LGBTQ + people's experiences with them. Through qualitative interviews with U.S. LGBTQ + residents (N = 19), we explore what LGBTQ + people experienced from LGBTQ + serving organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the challenges, barriers, and support that LGBTQ + people encountered, the meaning they received from LGBTQ + serving organizations, and the tensions between caring for self and others. We provide recommendations for how LGBTQ + serving organizations can better meet the needs of diverse LGBTQ + people.
