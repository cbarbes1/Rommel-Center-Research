AB According to theory, emotional intelligence (EI) and trait mindfulness should be positively associated with each other; nevertheless, the reported effect sizes of this relationship were mixed across studies. This meta-analysis was done to clarify this line of research. The analysis found that (1) EI had a statistically significant association with trait mindfulness (overall EI: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.48; self-report EI: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.48; mixed EI: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.49); (2) gender did not moderate the relationship between EI and trait mindfulness; (3) age was a statistically significant moderator of the relationship between EI and trait mindfulness (the association was stronger for older subjects); and (4) the type of scale used was a statistically significant moderator of the relationship between EI and trait mindfulness (FFMQ: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.72; FMI: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.79; MAAS: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.38; other scales: <(<(rho)over bar>)over cap> = 0.60).
