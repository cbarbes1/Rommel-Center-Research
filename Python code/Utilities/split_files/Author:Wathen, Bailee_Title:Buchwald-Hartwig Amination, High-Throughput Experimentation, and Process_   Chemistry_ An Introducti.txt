AB This three-part laboratory experiment investigates key aspects of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination cross-coupling reaction through guided-inquiry learning strategies. The first part of this experiment utilizes high-throughput experimentation techniques to reinforce, explore, and extend fundamental concepts that are represented in the classroom, including the use of air-free Schlenk techniques and heteronuclear NMR analysis. The second component challenges students to evaluate their results to design, set up, and perform a preparative-scale Buchwald-Hartwig amination. Finally, students purify and isolate their products using column chromatography allowing them to fully characterize their target molecules through a variety of analytical techniques. This experiment represents one of the final experiments performed in the fourth-year undergraduate chemistry curriculum and serves as a capstone learning experience for students.
