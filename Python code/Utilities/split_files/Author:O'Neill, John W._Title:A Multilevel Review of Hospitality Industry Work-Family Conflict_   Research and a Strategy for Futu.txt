AB Work-family conflict has become a growing area of research in the hospitality field. Research has previously shown that employees who experience conflict between their work and family roles are likely to report negative individual and job-related outcomes. Given the serious outcomes associated with work-family conflict, it is essential for researchers and practitioners to better understand why and when it occurs, as well as to identify possible interventions that may lessen its impact on employees. This systematic review synthesizes and summarizes the extant literature as it relates to work-family conflict. The results from the review provide insight into the well-established antecedents and outcomes of work-family conflict, while also highlighting areas that may require additional attention. The review concludes with a discussion of future research directions that may be used to advance the study of work-family conflict research.
