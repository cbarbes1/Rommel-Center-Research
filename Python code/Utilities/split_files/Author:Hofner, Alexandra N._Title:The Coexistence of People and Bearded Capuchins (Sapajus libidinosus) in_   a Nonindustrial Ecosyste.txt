AB As human activity increases in primate habitats, it is critical to understand people's perceptions of primates and of potential conflicts with them. We investigated the perceptions of crab-eating bearded capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) in two communities with different sources of revenue in Northeast Brazil. Parnaiba relies heavily on crab-catching, whereas Preguicas relies mostly on tourism. We conducted questionnaires (N = 421) and compared the responses of residents from the two communities and those of tourists in Preguicas. We also conducted interviews (N = 21) with residents of Preguicas to examine the influences of tourism, landscape change, and overlapping resource use on people's perceptions of capuchins. All residents reported seeing capuchins often, but residents in Preguicas reported liking them relatively more than residents of Parnaiba, where fewer respondents described capuchins as damaging property. Residents did not report conflict with the capuchins at either site. Tourists in Preguicas also did not observe human-capuchin conflicts. Although most residents knew that the capuchins were legally protected and believed that they had adequate food in the mangroves, some people reported feeding them at both sites. Tourists, who knew less about the capuchins and their habitat than did residents, were aware that providing food was illegal but were uncertain of the capuchins' protected status. Interviews confirmed that residents were very knowledgeable about capuchin ecology and changes in habituation and habitat use, given increased tourism, decreased hunting, and environmental change. Our results suggest that resource and spatial overlap does not necessarily result in perceived conflict, supporting previous ethnoprimatological work, and highlight areas where tourism and conservation initiatives may support a nonconflictive (harmonious) and sustainable, multispecies coexistence.
