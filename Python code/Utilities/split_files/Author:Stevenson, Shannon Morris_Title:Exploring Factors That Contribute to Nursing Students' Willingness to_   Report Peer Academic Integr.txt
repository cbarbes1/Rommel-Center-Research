AB AIMThe aim of the study was to examine and describe student perceptions of severity of violations, faculty support, and support for program improvement strategies related to willingness to report peer violations.BACKGROUNDPeer reporting is important when students witness dishonest behaviors. To foster academic integrity, exploration of the willingness to report is needed.METHODUsing McCabe's Academic Integrity Survey-Modified for Nursing Students, 442 baccalaureate students were surveyed.RESULTSThe more students felt faculty supported related policies, the more willing students were to report (r(s) = .298, alpha = .05). The more students understood what was considered a violation, the more willing they were to report (r(s) = .485, alpha = .05). The more students believed program-wide strategies could prevent violations, the more willing they were to report (r(s) = .231, alpha = .05).CONCLUSIONEducation that helps define academic integrity can contribute to nursing students' willingness to report peer violations. Faculty support of policies and program-wide strategies contribute.
