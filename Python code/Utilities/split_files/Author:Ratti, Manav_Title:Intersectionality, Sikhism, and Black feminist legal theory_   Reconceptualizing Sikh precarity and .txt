AB Intersectionality was developed by legal scholar Kimberle Williams Crenshaw in the late 1980s to broaden legal and epistemological frameworks for peoples at the intersection of multiple oppressions, such as racism and sexism. The theory has since proliferated and grown across many international academic and public contexts. This article examines intersectionality in Crenshaw's original formulation to argue for theoretical and political insights when intersectionality is applied to the multiply minoritized position of Sikhs in the US and India. I argue for six theoretical formations that can illuminate what I term intersectional Sikhism: intragroup solidarity, intergroup alliances, postsecularism, untranslatability, precarity, and intellectual intersectionality.

   conference, "Sikhs and South Asians in the Public Sphere: Precarious
   Minorities and the New Global Politics of Religion." I am honoured to
   have been invited to present by Arvind-Pal Mandair and Paushara Singh,
   and am profoundly indebted to all of my fellow participants,
   particularly Anneeth Kaur Hundle and Seema Sohi, for their generous
   feedback. For their comments and support throughout earlier drafts of
   this article, I thank the anonymous referees, Dean J. Kotlowski, Roselyn
   Lemus, and Bob Zwicker. Research toward this article was supported by a
   Salisbury University Faculty Mini-Grant and conducted as a Visiting
   Scholar at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Archives and Research Library in
