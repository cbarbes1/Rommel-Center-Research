AB This study examined the impact of a nursing course redesign from traditional face-to-face to a hybrid format on student outcomes, workload allocation, and associated costs. In this quasi-experimental study, baccalaureate students received either traditional (n = 47) or hybrid delivery (n = 46); each group had equal degree-type representation. Average exam scores were analyzed using an independent Rest, with no significant differences found between groups. Faculty workload decreased by one third, and there was a 16.6 percent reduction in overall costs to implement the course. Course redesign can be effective for reducing faculty workload and costs while achieving course outcomes.
