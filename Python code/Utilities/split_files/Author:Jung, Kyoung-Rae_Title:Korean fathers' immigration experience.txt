AB Korean immigrant fathers were interviewed and the consensual qualitative research (CQR) method was employed to analyze the data. Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family's well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.
