AB Let IG(k,2n + 1) be the odd symplectic Grassmannian. It is a quasi-homogeneous space with homogeneous-like behavior. A very limited description of curve neighborhoods of Schubert varieties in IG(k,2n + 1) was used by Mihalcea and the second named author to prove an (equivariant) quantum Chevalley rule. In this paper, we give a full description of the irreducible components of curve neighborhoods in terms of the Hecke product of (appropriate) Weyl group elements, k-strict partitions, and BC-partitions. The latter set of partitions respect the Bruhat order with inclusions. Our approach follows the philosophy of Buch and Mihalcea's curve neighborhood calculations of Schubert varieties in the homogeneous cases.
