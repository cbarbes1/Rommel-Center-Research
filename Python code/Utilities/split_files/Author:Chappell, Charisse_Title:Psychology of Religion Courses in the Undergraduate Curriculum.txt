AB Because religion is important in the lives of many Americans, psychology should study religious behavior as it does other areas of human functioning. With the increased emphasis upon diversity, this should be reflected in the extent to which psychology of religion courses are offered. The current study examined the extent to which psychology of religion courses were offered in the undergraduate curriculum and the knowledge gained by students who take this course. The results suggested there has been no increase in the proportion of psychology of religion courses offered at the undergraduate level, in contrast to increases in these courses at the graduate level. This study also found there was a gain in the scientific knowledge of psychology of religion for students who took this course relative to another course in psychology. This study suggests that perhaps more courses of this nature should be offered to undergraduate students.
