AB In the context of the Great Challenges for Social Work, this conceptual paper envisions a "radical imaginary" as a call to action to incrementally build an epistemically just ethics infrastructure in the coming decade that centers race, ethnicity, and culture. The existing challenges of the dominance of moral absolutes and Eurocentric ethics curriculum were examined. Three change processes were proposed to help build a futuristic infrastructure for ethics praxis with a thicker, more equitable, and more inclusive moral social fabric. This "radical imaginary" promotes anti-racist and anti-oppressive ethics praxis that seeks to eliminate both ethical social isolation and ethics-based racism.
