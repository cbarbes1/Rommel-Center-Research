# Cole Goals
- Turn Citation data into easily readable aggregated format
- Turn Proposal Data into easily readable aggregated format
- Get the totals of each category of data like: "A" level publications
- Scrape data from university faculty directory
- Aggregate the faculty directory into a readable format
- Create database for all this data
