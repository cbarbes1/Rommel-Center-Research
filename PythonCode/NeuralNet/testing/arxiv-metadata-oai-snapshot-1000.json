To explain the emergent\nclassicality of these variables from an underlying quantum theory, it is\ntherefore necessary to show, firstly, that these variables exhibit negligible\ninterference, and secondly, that the probabilities for histories of them are\npeaked around hydrodynamic evolution. The implementation of this programme in\nthe context of the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory is\ndescribed. It is argued that, for a system of weakly interacting particles, the\neigenstates of local densities (averaged over a sufficiently large volume)\nremain approximate eigenstates under time evolution. This is a consequence of\ntheir close connection with the corresponding exactly conserved (and so exactly\ndecoherent) quantities. The subsequent derivation of hydrodynamic equations\nfrom decoherent histories is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 1999 15:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Halliwell","J.

Consequently, our class of generalized master systems actually\nconsists of a (smaller) class of completely integrable systems, and our\nconstruction yields a multi-Hamiltonian structure for these systems. As an\napplication, we construct a multi-Hamiltonian structure for the so-called\nmaster systems introduced by D. Mumford.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 1994 12:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03","authors_parsed":[["Bueken","Peter","","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"]]}

By the conjecture of Novikov these ``physical''\nsolutions, which are analytically exceptional probably have much stronger\nsymmetry then the other solutions but it is not proved until now. Two\nasymptotic methods were developed in the previous paper -- nonlinear\nsemiclassics (or the Bogolubov-Whitham averaging method) and the linear\nsemiclassics for the ``Isomonodromic'' method. The nonlinear semiclassics gives\na good approximation for the general (``non-physical'') solutions of P-1 but\nfails in the ``physical'' case. In our paper the linear semiclasics for the\n``physical'' solutions of the P-1 equations is studied. In particular\nconnection between the semiclassics on Riemann surfaces and Hamiltonian\nfoliations on these surfaces is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 1995 20:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 1995 13:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2000 15:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03","authors_parsed":[["Grinevich","P.

Such problems can be characterized by the question as\nto how the asymptotic behaviours of solutions are related as the independent\nvariable is allowed to pass towards infinity along different directions in the\ncomplex plane. Connection problems have been previously tackled by a variety of\nmethods. Frequently these are based on the ideas of isomonodromic deformation\nand the matching of WKB solutions. However, the implementation of these methods\noften tends to be heuristic in nature and so the task of rigorising the process\nis complicated. The method we propose here develops uniform approximations to\nsolutions. This removes the need to match solutions, is rigorous, and can lead\nto the solution of connection problems with minimal computational effort. Our\nmethod is reliant on finding uniform approximations of differential equations\nof the generic form ${d^2\\phi}/{d\\eta^2} = - \\xi^2F(\\eta,\\xi)\\phi$ as the\ncomplex-valued parameter $\\xi \\to \\infty.$ The details of the treatment rely\nheavily on the locations of the zeros of the function $F$ in this limit. If\nthey are isolated then a uniform approximation to solutions can be derived in\nterms of Airy functions of suitable argument. On the other hand, if two of the\nzeros of $F$ coalesce as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ then an approximation can be\nderived in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. In this paper we discuss both\ncases, but illustrate our technique in action by applying the parabolic\ncylinder case to the ``classical'' connection problem associated with the\nsecond Painlev{\\'e} transcendent. Future papers will show how the technique can\nbe applied with very little change to the other Painlev{\\'e} equations, and to\nthe wider problem of the asymptotic behaviour of the general solution to any of\nthese equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 1996 15:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08","authors_parsed":[["Bassom","A.

The principal result, which forms\nthe basis of our SEP method, is the proof that any eigenfunction of the general\nKP hierarchy can be represented as a spectral integral over the Baker-Akhiezer\n(BA) wave function with a spectral density expressed in terms of SEP. In fact,\nthe spectral representations of the (adjoint) BA functions can, in turn, be\nconsidered as defining equations for the KP hierarchy. The SEP method is\nsubsequently used to show how the reduction of the full KP hierarchy to the\nconstrained KP hierarchies can be given entirely in terms of linear constraint\nequations on the pertinent tau-functions. The concept of SEP turns out to be\ncrucial in providing a description of constrained KP hierarchies in the\nlanguage of universal Sato Grassmannian and finding the non-isospectral\nVirasoro symmetry generators acting on the underlying tau-functions. The SEP\nmethod is used to write down generalized binary Darboux-Backlund\ntransformations for constrained KP hierarchies whose orbits are shown to\ncorrespond to a new Toda model on a square lattice. As a result, we obtain a\nseries of new determinant solutions for the tau-functions generalizing the\nknown Wronskian (multi-soliton) solutions. Finally, applications to random\nmatrix models in condensed matter physics are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 1997 21:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 1997 14:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30","authors_parsed":[["Aratyn","H.",""],["Nissimov","E.",""],["Pacheva","S.",""]]}

The latter is then\nstudied in more detail, still using the Bethe Ansatz and quantum groups, so as\nto characterize the spectrum of the low energy excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 1998 16:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Zinn-Justin","P.",""]]}

Using the previously found connections between the ALH and\nother integrable systems I derive functional equations which are equivalent to\nthe AKNS, derivative nonlinear Schrodinger and Davey-Stewartson hierarchies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 1998 10:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2002 14:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09","authors_parsed":[["Vekslerchik","V.

Therefore the\nlinear property of planarity seems to be a basic geometric property underlying\nintegrability. We present the geometric meaning of its tau-function, as the\npotential connecting its forward and backward data. We present the theory of\ntransformations of the quadrilateral lattice, which is based on the discrete\nanalogue of the theory of rectilinear congruences. In particular, we discuss\nthe discrete analogues of the Laplace, Combescure, Levy, radial and fundamental\ntransformations and their interrelations. We also show how the sequence of\nLaplace transformations of a quadrilateral surface is described by the discrete\nToda system. We finally show that these classical transformations are strictly\nrelated to the basic operators associated with the quantum field theoretical\nformulation of the multicomponent Kadomtsev-Petviashvilii hierarchy. We review\nthe properties of quadrilateral hyperplane lattices, which play an interesting\nrole in the reduction theory, when the introduction of additional geometric\nstructures allows to establish a connection between point and hyperplane\nlattices.
