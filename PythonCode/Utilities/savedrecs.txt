AB ObjectiveSexual victimization experience is a health concern among college students and rape empathy may help address it. Empathy with a rape victim was examined based on sexual victimization experience, acknowledgment (i.e., labeling experience "sexual assault," "rape"), and gender.MethodUndergraduates (n = 531) completed measures of sexual victimization experience and rape empathy.ResultsAcknowledged victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged victims and nonvictims, but the latter two groups did not differ. Unacknowledged female victims reported greater empathy than unacknowledged male victims, but no gender difference emerged for acknowledged victims or nonvictims. Victimized men were less likely than victimized women to acknowledge their experience.ConclusionsThe association found between acknowledgment and empathy may inform efforts to address sexual victimization (e.g., prevention, victim support), and men should not be overlooked. Unacknowledged victims and greater acknowledgment rates among women than men may have contributed to previously reported gender differences in rape empathy.

AB Binary success/failure data is an important type of data which occurs in a wide range of fields and application domains. We examine a new overdispersed statistical distribution for this type of data which is particularly suited to 'big data' contexts. The distribution, called the tilted beta-binomial distribution, has a number of attractive properties with regard to tractability and interpretability. We apply the distribution to the analysis of Maryland population data from the 2010 U.S. Census. We find the tilted beta-binomial distribution provides a superior fit compared to the beta-binomial distribution in the current data set and provides new options for modeling success/failure data. In addition to addressing overdispersion, the distribution has implications for generating new insights by revealing underlying latent subgroups in data.

AB Two studies examined relations of humor styles with well-being, social support, cognitive reappraisal, and social competence. In Study 1 (N = 108), self-enhancing and affiliative humor were associated fewer health difficulties and less psychological distress, mediated by reappraisal and social support, respectively. Self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, mediated by both reappraisal and social support. Social competence moderated the relation of aggressive humor with social support: Individuals high on both aggressive humor and communication difficulties reported the least support. Study 2 followed undergraduates (N = 193) over ten weeks. T1 results for psychological distress replicated Study 1. Social support and reappraisal mediated relations of humor styles with T1 distress, and social support indirectly mediated the relation of aggressive humor with increased T2 distress. Aggressive humor was associated with T1 health difficulties, and self-defeating humor predicted greater health difficulties over time. Reappraisal and social support indirectly mediated the relation of self-enhancing and affiliative humor with fewer Ti health difficulties, and social support indirectly mediated the relation of aggressive humor with increased health difficulties over time. Communication difficulties moderated the relation of aggressive humor with fewer T1 positive interactions and greater somatic symptoms over time. Relations largely held controlling for shared variance among humor styles.

DE Aggregate; Context; Design-based research; Learning expectations; Mode
ID CONTEXT
AB The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics have a widespread impact on children's statistical learning opportunities. The Grade 6 standards are particularly ambitious in the goals they set. In this critique, experiences helping children work toward the Grade 6 Common Core statistics expectations are used in conjunction with previous research to identify ways in which the Grades 4-6 standards might be supplemented or revised to help maximize learning. It is suggested that opportunities for children to perceive datasets as aggregates and to draw reasonable conclusions about statistical data by attending to context should be purposefully introduced in Grades 4-5. Currently, the Common Core does not have explicit learning standards for these activities in fourth and fifth grade. It is also suggested that teachers help students question their natural tendencies to focus extensively on the mode when summarizing data. The current standards do not specifically mention the mode. Revising or supplementing the Common Core in the suggested ways holds potential to make the Grade 6 statistical learning standards more attainable for children and to help teachers better anticipate the statistical thinking tendencies that are likely to emerge during classroom discourse.

ID POPULAR SUPPORT; ARMED CONFLICT
AB This paper examines the hitherto unexplored subject of nonstate rebels seeking the status of sole representatives. Why do nonstate armed groups seek the status of sole representatives?, What strategies do they employ to achieve the status of sole representatives?, Is the status merely symbolic, or does it fetch tangible benefits? These research questions are explored by treating Sri Lanka's LTTE as a case study. Primary and secondary data formed the basis of the analysis. The LTTE used three strategies to achieve a hegemonic disposition within the Tamil community. They are: (1) elimination of rival groups, (2) incorporation of some groups, and (3) battlefield efficacy. The rebels used the claim of sole representation to ensure bilateral talks with the government, get the ban on it lifted, and control the proposed interim administrative structure. The strategy worked to a certain extent, but at least partially contributed to its downfall in 2009.

AB This study's objective is to examine the role of resilience in the dynamic between academic burnout and psychological distress using a sample of US undergraduate accounting majors. It extends prior research-that is, Garcia-Izquierdo et al. (2018), who examine these relationships using a sample of Spanish nursing students. For this study, a survey instrument was concurrently administered to 443 accounting majors at four geographically dispersed universities. Two alternative models are tested. The first model positions resilience as an exogenous predictor, and dimensions of academic burnout antecedent to psychological distress. The results indicate a significant negative association between resilience, psychological distress, and each of the three academic burnout dimensions. In addition, emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy have a significant positive association with psychological distress. The alternative model positions psychological distress antecedent to each of the academic burnout dimensions. The results indicate that resilience has a significant negative association with psychological distress, cynicism, and academic inefficacy, but not emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological distress has significant positive associations with each academic burnout dimension. In the alternative model specification, resilience is also found to moderate the association between psychological distress and academic inefficacy. This single moderating effect notwithstanding, the findings suggest that the primary role of resilience is that of a compensatory mechanism by acting as an independent exogenous predictor of distress and burnout.

AB Student evaluations of teaching are ubiquitous in higher education; however, most prior research has focused on the numeric ratings, with little systematic attention given to the qualitative comments. In this study, written comments were collected as part of the regular evaluation of a community health nursing course over four semesters. Taken as a whole, student comments were strikingly consistent and mostly negative. Students emphasized the authority of the textbook and framed the course as preparation for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). Instructor efforts to focus on critical analysis of social issues were met with confusion, suspicion, and resistance. Student comments were further analyzed in relation to 3 levels of discourse: the student/teacher level, the nursing-education level, and the social-historical level. For each level, the comments reveal problems, but not the ones suggested by a conventional reading of student evaluations. If students and teachers have conflicting expectations about goals and methods for learning, formal student evaluations may be less useful as a measure of teaching effectiveness. This study also raises troubling concerns about current practices in nursing pedagogy, particularly the emphasis on standardized testing and highly structured didactics, and the overlap between student evaluation systems and the technologies of neoliberalism.

AB This paper examines the impact of regulation-driven trade barriers on export entrepreneurship in a panel of 60 countries between 2006 and 2014. The paper finds robust evidence that unfavorable trade regulations significantly reduce export entry rate and export entry density (two critical measures of export entrepreneurship) by increasing the time and cost associated with documentary and customs compliance procedures. These findings support the hypothesis that less conducive business regulations are an important domestic supply constraint which impedes export entrepreneurship by increasing trade costs. In addition, the paper finds that the magnitude of the negative relationship between export entrepreneurship and regulation-driven trade barriers is significantly more pronounced in countries with poor governance quality. Two measures of governance quality (i.e., political stability and rule of law) are shown to be relatively more significant in aiding favorable trade regulations that promote export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation-driven trade barriers has a positive impact on net entry rate and survival rates of first-, second- and third-year exporters, and high-quality governance institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive relationship.

AB This article examines attempts to demonstrate the truth of physiocratic principles in eighteenth-century Baden. Emphasizing the importance of the so-called net yield (produit net), a surplus product understood to be created primarily in agriculture, the physiocrats advanced a new science of material prosperity and moral welfare. Despite its alleged "self-evidence," physiocracy invited strong criticism from those who denied the force of its abstractions. Ultimately regarded as ill-fated and unconvincing, these trials were significant for their attempt to offer an experiential demonstration aimed at persuading doubters and silencing critics. The apparent failure notwithstanding, the episode illustrates how the idiom and practice of experiment served as a powerful resource for generating conviction in the eighteenth century, even in matters extending beyond the emerging natural sciences.

AB Ethics are principles which provide a framework for making decisions that best reflect a set of values. Cataloging carries power, so ethical decision-making is crucial. Because cataloging requires decision-making in areas that differ from other library work, cataloging ethics are a distinct subset of library ethics. Cataloging ethics draw on the primary values of serving the needs of users and providing access to materials. Cataloging ethics are not new, but they have received increased attention since the 1970s. Major current issues in cataloging ethics include the creation of a code of ethics; ongoing debate on the appropriate role of neutrality in cataloging misleading materials and in subject heading lists and classification schemes; how and to what degree considerations of privacy and self-determination should shape authority work; and whether or not our current cataloging codes are sufficiently user-focused.

AB This paper explores top-down, enacted, institutional pushbacks to supermobility and superdiversity in the under-examined arena of academia using emerging frameworks in political economy and the geography of mobility. Zooming in on the discoursal framings of a recent year of job advertisements on a popular, open-source forum for linguists supplemented with qualitatively and quantitatively sourced data from international, national, and local institutional contexts, the paper examines how macrocontextual pushes toward political populism combined with a synchronous tightening of job markets in academia have enacted a plethora of labels for temporary work in lieu of permanent academic positions-now, increasingly the only option for job seekers in a hypercompetitive academic market. In this manufacturing of euphemization discourse, we witness the invention of novel, microlinguistically rendered lexicalizations of semiotic redundancy in academic capitalism's own obfuscation of profit margins, and a concomitant manufacturing of a new discourse of rationality in which floating semiotic signifiers at multiple scales deploy nationality-criteria to justify ethnic exclusion and/or entry into academic space. More crucially, in these commonsensical framings, we encounter both causation and consequence of newly enacted barriers to transnational mobility. In challenging the myth of porous borders for mobile professionals in the post-global moment, these emerging linguistic signifiers point to the ascendancy of a new public affectivity on display in intellectual spheres and a saturation of sentiment toward illiberality.

AB Background: Because nursing students do not always have opportunities to interact with individuals with mental illness due to various factors such as limited clinical sites, an innovative teaching strategy was developed. Method: A plan was developed to collaborate with the theater department to offer undergraduate theater students an opportunity to practice acting skills while taking an independent study. These theater students, trained as standardized patients ( SPs), engaged with senior nursing students enrolled in a psychiatric mental health nursing clinical course in a baccalaureate program. Results: This process has been successfully implemented for the past 2 years. With 10 theater students completing the independent study and 180 nursing students engaging in interactions with SPs, improvements in communication skills for nursing students have been seen. Conclusion: Because this is a pilot project, additional research should be conducted to further explore the effectiveness of learning for both nursing and theater students.

TI Disarming Montage
SO FILM CRITICISM
LA English
DT Article
AB This essay examines the work of two major contemporary artists-Hito Steyerl and Harun Farockito suggest a novel framework for considering cinematic politics in general, and the politics of montage in particular, in the contemporary moment. Both artists are deeply critical of the ways in which montage, across the history of cinema, has been associated with a range of violent and militaristic images. Discussing the work of Steyerl and Farocki along these lines, this essay seeks to displace the historical analogy between cinema and war by foregrounding the ways in which cinematic politics may be grounded in a spatial and geographic language. Grounding these claims is an examination of two particular works: On Construction of Griffith's Films (Harun Farocki, 2006) and Abstract (Hito Steyerl, 2012), with the second part of this essay reserved for a close reading of the latter.

AB Scholars rank Franklin D. Roosevelt as a great President, and Hollywood agrees. During his presidency and in the decades that followed, Roosevelt appeared in various film and television productions, emerging as an idealized leader who overcomes physical disability, inspires the public, and pursues wise policies. The origins of, reasons behind, and manifestations of this tenaciously consistent image are the subject of this article. The process began with FDR's own successful leadership and media (including film) savvy. It was sustained by the influence of Roosevelt's family and admirers in the entertainment industry. It seldom has been challenged, even as portraits of FDR widened across of a variety of film and television genres from the 1970s onward.

TI Using Toolkits to Improve Students' Skills in Advocacy
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Advocacy is widely recognized as a nursing responsibility. Speaking up, a form of advocacy, is known to benefit patient safety and quality of care yet research shows that nurses are hesitant to speak up and face multiple barriers when deciding to do so. Method: A toolkit that included web-based learning modules and simulation experience with a standardized patient was developed to enhance advocacy skills in baccalaureate nursing students. Student perceptions of the efficacy of this approach were used to revise and improve toolkit materials. Results: There were 131 participants over four semesters. Students reported the toolkit helped them understand how to use advocacy skills (87%), allowed them to use critical thinking (97%), and practice advocacy (94%). Conclusion: Educational experiences like this promote development of students' advocacy skills in a safe environment and can be used to bridge the gap between expectation and practice.

AB Empathy with a rape victim was examined based on knowing a rape victim (not oneself), personal sexual victimization experience, and participant gender. Undergraduates (n = 531) at a midsize public university in the Northeast United States completed the Rape-Victim Empathy Scale, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization, and questions regarding knowing a rape victim. Empathy scores were greater for those who reported knowing a rape victim than for those who did not. Women with personal sexual victimization experience reported greater empathy than men with personal sexual victimization experience and all nonvictims, but no differences emerged among female nonvictims and all men. Findings suggest that knowing a rape victim may provide some degree of vicarious experience with rape that helps individuals better understand a rape victim's perspective, and factors influencing rape empathy among men and nonvictims needs more attention in future research.

ID MEMORY
AB This article investigates the collecting philosophies and practices of William Henry Dorsey, a nineteenth-century African American collector and archivist in Philadelphia. Over many decades, Dorsey created an archive that documented black professional, artistic, and political accomplishments in order to preserve these histories, influence public perception of African Americans, and enable future research on historical black figures. In doing so, he established and strengthened networks between individuals and associations that shared the goal of celebrating and preserving black history. This article focuses on how Dorsey's archive enabled forms of sociability among the many individuals and groups that used the materials in Dorsey's collection. In focusing on the role that Dorsey played in collating, editing, and disseminating information about black achievements and contributions to world history, this article argues that Dorsey preserved - and therefore helped create - black histories that could be remembered, studied, and shared to refute the illusion of white supremacy.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIA; SAURASHTRA
AB This article reconsiders a religious institution in India during the early colonial era as a manifestation of regional influence, or a non-statist public force. Founded by Sahajanand Swami, the Hindu devotional (bhakti) community known as the Swaminarayan Sampradaya expanded in the area that is today Gujarat in western India. The community arose as a source of popular influence in a region that lacked a dominant state at this time. Its creation was forged in relation to local struggles for power and resources, involving princely states, Maratha and East India Company powers, Kathi chieftains, and broader social and cultural changes in the nineteenth century. Historically examining the process of community expansion in the region through aspects like patronage and cultural production, I argue that the sampradaya's articulation of devotion internalized political acumen to navigate material realities successfully. Effectively, the modern articulation enabled adherents to broker power from diverse networks and strengthen the community's complex, multifaceted authority in Gujarat.

SO REVIEW OF QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Monetary sterilization; Exchange rates; Net foreign assets;
   Cointegration
ID POLICY; MODEL
AB This paper separates the exchange rate effect of monetary sterilization from the scale effect as a rationale for a modification of the measure of sterilization rate. The Chinese episode for 2002-2012 is characterized by a robust trend both for renminbi to appreciate vis-a-vis the dollar and for net official foreign assets to grow, which relates two of four scenarios that I generally identify for possible sterilization responses to changes in the exchange rate and official net foreign assets. I find that the modified sterilization rate in China exhibits a sort of strong "hawkish bias" in which sterilization is more sensitive to the exchange rate appreciation than to its depreciation, on one hand, and to the growth of net official foreign assets than to its decline, on the other. While there is no econometric evidence for the "hawkish bias" in the long run, the significant evidence exists for the short-run asymmetry of sterilization adjustment to be biased more toward the hawkish side than dovish side.

AB Prior research links adaptive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) with enhanced psychological well-being and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating) with worse psychological well-being, primarily through humor styles' influence on individuals' social interactions and efforts to positively reframe stressors. The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.

ID STANDARDIZED PATIENTS; STUDENTS
AB Caring for individuals with mental illness requires a core set of skills: knowledge of various disorders; therapeutic communication; collaboration with the multidisciplinary team; proficiency as an advocate whether for individuals, families, groups, or populations; and conflict management. In the current study, students completed toolkits with standardized patient experiences (SPEs) to practice core skill sets. Growth occurred in students' therapeutic communication and their ability to care for standardized or simulated patients with complex mental health issues. Proficiency in interprofessional collaboration, advocacy, and conflict management was also noted. Providing students with opportunities to apply leadership skills to care for individuals with complex mental illness may not always be possible in "real world" settings. Use of SPEs and toolkit activities can bridge the gap between classroom/clinical and real world settings and were highly effective in helping students meet core skill sets in mental health settings.

DE Discourse; Language; Probability; Vocabulary development
AB Normative discourse about probability requires shared meanings for disciplinary vocabulaty. Previous research indicates that students' meanings for probability vocabulary often differ from those of mathematicians, creating a need to attend to developing students' use of language. Current standards documents conflict in their recommendations about how this should occur. In the present study, we conducted microgenetic research to examine the vocabulary use of four students before, during, and after lessons from a cycle of design-based research attending to probability vocabulary. In characterizing students' normative and nonnormative uses of language, we draw implications for the design of curriculum, standards, and further research. Specifically, we illustrate the importance of attending to incrementality, multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity to foster students' probability vocabulary development.

AB How German were German anarchists in the United States and Brazil? Did the experience of exile and immigration preserve or even heighten a national identity among radicals who openly espoused revolutionary internationalism? Anarchists distinguished between nation and nationality on the one hand, and the state and nationalism on the other. This article examines expressions of nationality by a handful of German anarchist editors and writers from the 1880s to the end of World War II. They wanted to be stateless, but not nationless. This article argues that German exile anarchists in the United States and Brazil expressed a militant, countercultural, antistatist and anticlerical nationality. They were 'rooted cosmopolitans': They identified with the international revolutionary tradition and at the same time remained attached to Germany's heritage of radical politics, arts and humanities. There was a remarkable consistency in their commentary levelled against Bismarck, the Kaiser, the Weimar government and the Nazis either in Germany or in the host country. Anarchists advocated for a borderless global federation of free communities and, to that end, rejected nationalism and urged people to stop 'seeing like a state' by exposing the false promises and crimes of statism.

AB Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants, I propose the notion of chronotopization to understand how perceptions of normative social behavior are dynamically constructed and organized with respect to time, space, and the people involved in the interaction. The differently scaled chronotopes of normalcy (re-)constructed and enregistered in these processes, I argue, guide social actors' sociolinguistic behaviors and normative judgments. Through an analysis of participants' metacommentaries on appropriate language choice, I discuss how chronotopic and scalar understandings of normalcy can offer us a broader theory of language use and can be applied to a wide array of sociolinguistic phenomena beyond language choice.

AB Korean immigrant fathers were interviewed and the consensual qualitative research (CQR) method was employed to analyze the data. Five domains (challenges, identity, values, relationship, and well-being) and seventeen categories emerged. Participants experienced implicit discrimination and cultural barriers. They identified themselves as Koreans and valued family's well-being as their priority. They made efforts to find meaning and satisfaction by supporting children to become independent adults. Participants were aware of their traditional parenting styles and the intergenerational cultural gap with their children. As first-generation immigrants, Korean immigrant fathers reported a lack of genuine relationships with both Korean Americans and non-Korean Americans outside of their families. Although participants reported freedom from the pressure caused by interdependent Korean culture, they felt homesickness and emptiness without their own valued life goals.

AB Background: The nurse faculty shortage has impacted current and future nursing workforce needs and health outcomes. What has not been expansively reported is the perspective of nursing program administrators as they grapple with the nurse faculty shortage and its effect in their schools. Purpose: The purpose was to explore nursing program administrators' perspectives of the nurse faculty shortage. Method: Administrators from 8 community colleges and 8 universities representing undergraduate and graduate nursing programs in the mid-Atlantic region participated in semistructured interviews pre-coronavirus disease (SARS COVID-19). Researchers used a 7-stage Heideggerian hermeneutic analysis. Findings: Twenty-four interviews elicited 4 themes: onboarding and integration; "elephant in the room"; making do: getting by; and changing expectations. Conclusions: Administrators faced increasing faculty workloads, academic/practice pay disparities, and staffing challenges-a stark contrast to their goal of teaching excellence, quality student outcomes, and faculty satisfaction. An unexpected finding was a deterioration in workplace climate and its untoward effects on meeting workforce needs.

AB Jien's familial connection to the highest echelons of state bureaucracy ensured his rapid rise and fall within the Tendai Buddhist establishment, illustrating his duality as cleric and worldly politician. Yet the divided portrait of Jien refracted by different academic disciplines obscures Jien's life and motivations. Using materials written by and about him, I examine Jien's rise to prominence, his connection to the power centers of his day, his role as a spiritual authority, his investiture of land and positions to his disciples, and his often-ignored role as a prophetic visionary to paint a more holistic picture of his life. I argue that Jien held a consistent spiritually infused worldview most visible during a confrontation with his former sovereign, Retired Emperor Gotoba, on the eve of the Jakyu War (12.21). I argue we can only understand that confrontation by reconciling his political interests and his religious faith.

AB The height of a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) is defined as the difference c- b. In this paper, building on the Height-Excess Enumeration Theorem, we show how to generate primitive Pythagorean triples of a given height using powers of a single matrix. Then, we briefly discuss other matrices that both map any Pythagorean triple to another and also preserve a triple's height. We also note how Pythagorean triples with a given leg difference can be generated using matrices.

AB Currently, there is renewed interest in organizations providinggreater economic benefits to its members given the widening divideamong social classes. A major source of alternatives to capitalistorganizations in the U.S. was the co-operative movement sponsoredby the Knights of Labor during 1870-1889. This study examines cases of the Knights' producer cooperativesto understand how they functioned and why they failed.The intent of the co-operatives was to restore worker independenceand control over their work in the emerging factory system. This study applies core frames of social movements to examinethe motivation and processes the Knights used to establish their cooperatives.Micro histories of selected co-ops in three regionsof the U.S. were developed from primary research conducted duringthe 1880s as well as contemporary journals and newspapers. Rather than being radical, the co-operatives were based on Americanrepublican ideals, and they borrowed governance structures similar to corporations, both of which contributed to their success. Reasons for the failure of the Knights and their co-ops areexamined. The legacy of the Knights' producer co-ops is discussedalong with ideas for future research.

AB Increasingly trauma scholars are exploring the susceptibility of mental health providers to secondary trauma reactions. The current study explores the relationship between clinical social work practice with trauma-exposed clients and secondary traumatic stress among social workers. The intent of this study is to identify the role various factors play in the development of secondary trauma (also known as compassion fatigue). A simple random sample of National Association of Social Workers members were asked to participate. Participants completed an online survey that explored their exposure and responses to secondary traumatic stress. The online survey consisted of standardized measures including the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale and The Coping Strategies Inventory which assesses secondary trauma and self-care strategies, respectively (Bober, Regehr, & Zhou, 2006; Bride, Robinson, Yegidis, & Figley, 2003). The magnitude of work (the extent and intensity of time working with trauma-exposed clients) is assessed by a non-standardized measure which consists of clinical caseloads composition questions. Job satisfaction is measured by items taken from the National Association of Social Workers' workplace questionnaire (Whitaker & Arrington, 2008). 161 social workers completed the online survey. It required approximately 35 minutes to complete. This project empirically demonstrated that high-magnitude social work practice (providing therapeutic intervention to trauma survivors, i.e. military service members and veterans) is associated with higher levels of secondary trauma. There is also empirical evidence that self-care strategies can mitigate the impact of the secondary trauma. Educational and workforce implications for study findings are discussed.

In this quasi-experimental study, baccalaureate students received either traditional (n = 47) or hybrid delivery (n = 46); each group had equal degree-type representation. Average exam scores were analyzed using an independent Rest, with no significant differences found between groups. Faculty workload decreased by one third, and there was a 16.6 percent reduction in overall costs to implement the course. Course redesign can be effective for reducing faculty workload and costs while achieving course outcomes.

AB The field of economics is undergoing a paradigm shift, marked by what has become known as the "credibility revolution." This shift has impacted what economists write about, how they organize and structure their papers, and where they chose to publish their findings. This paper traces publishing trends from the 100 most cited papers in the decades from 1970 to 2019 (500 papers in total). Data suggest that the field has become more empirical and that the structure of papers is more standardized, often following a format that is closer to that of scientific papers. Increases in the percentage of women first-listed authors and the gender ratio are noted and found to be correlated with emerging fields. Most interestingly, a decreasing number of highly cited papers are from what are generally considered the "Top 5" journals in economics, suggesting increasing importance of articles published outside of the Top 5.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

ID FALSE-CONSENSUS; AVAILABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; CERTAINTY; ACCURACY;

AB Established social psychology literature shows that people demonstrate a systematic bias when estimating the proportion of others who hold their viewpoint on a range of issues; the majority regularly underestimates agreement, and the minority shows even greater error in overestimating agreement with their viewpoint. Applying this to climate change may help us better understand the determinants of public opinion on that issue. Across four studies, we found that people who believe climate change is happening (the majority) underestimate the percentage of other people who hold their view, whereas those who do not believe climate change is happening (the minority) greatly overestimate agreement with their view. We consistently found this pattern for other contemporary issues where there was a clear majority/minority distinction. Furthermore, greater certainty of one's position on climate change was related to greater and more accurate estimates of agreement among the majority, whereas low certainty was associated with estimates closer to 50%. Consistent with cognitive availability as a mechanism for these findings, exploratory analyses suggest that greater certainty of climate change happening is associated with a greater subjective knowledge and frequency of thinking and hearing about climate change, and talking about it with others. Finding the majority/minority pattern of consensus bias for climate change and other issues suggests that general approaches, such as providing accurate normative data and targeting efforts according to a population's belief certainty, may impact public sentiment and engagement on climate change.

AB Technological advancements have made it easier for firms to bypass traditional distribution networks and establish subscription-based direct-to-consumer (SBDTC) channels. Despite their growing popularity, little is known about the effectiveness of these channels. However, pursuing these new channels may not be the best decision for firms even though technology allows it and, in some instances, consumers demand it. Results from an event study of SBDTC channel additions in the cable television industry show that they complicate channel relationships and can lead to conflict, which reduce firm value. Further analysis reveals that firm-specific characteristics and strategic execution factors operate to mitigate the loss in firm value. Specifically, the study results show that channel power diminishes the negative impact of channel conflict, suggesting that firms with greater channel power benefit from adding SBDTC channels. The study also finds that firms marketing high-quality, differentiated offerings are rewarded with more favorable firm valuations.

AB The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) expects practitioner training to include strategies for effective practice with individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds (CSWE, 2015). Additionally, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) sets standards for cultural competence and professional conduct in an attempt to eradicate unfair treatment (NASW, 2001). To align with these accreditation and professional organization guidelines, schools of social work need to be more deliberate about teaching diversity, inclusion, social justice (Greeno, Fedina, Rushovich, Moore, Linsenmeyer, & Wirt, 2017). Social work educators aim to train students on diverse client needs and to promote equality. Yet, there is limited research on the effectiveness of educational efforts regarding students' knowledge or awareness of equity issues. Educators must begin to proactively assess the extent to which students are prepared to work with diverse clients and advocate for social justice. To this end, this research study measures the impact of a course created to explore the concepts of privilege and oppression on undergraduate social work students. An online survey was designed to answer three (3) research questions about students' knowledge, understanding, and values concerning diversity. Findings from this research project can inform social work course development, curriculum enhancements, and diversity education efforts. Examining the effectiveness of social work educational efforts in these areas is particularly urgent, given our current social climate in the United States, where respect for differences is undervalued.

TI Seeing Through Serpent and Eagle Eyes: Teachers as Handlers of Memories
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB Background/Context: This paper is part of the special issue "Reimagining Research and Practice at the Crossroads of Philosophy,, Teaching. and 'Teacher Education." We propose that there is a vital connection in teaching between curriculum and memories that should be fostered in our classrooms. Because memories are alive and bring meaning to our lives, they need to be handled with care. Unfortunately, /lawmen much of teaching risks to simply embalm what is already dead. We examine how the living work of teachers might reposition curriculum as a body of dynamic memories: a constellation of struggles and belongings, failures and accomplishments. The role of the teacher, in this context, is as a handler of those memories.
   Research Design: Our approach derives from sustained interaction as we have sought to bring our scholarly backgrounds in philosophy of education and English teacher education, respectively, into dynamic contact. The methodology of the inquiry is mixed in that it combines teacher narratives (our own) with critical conceptual analysis, collective memory work, and phenomenology. Drawing on a bibliography of texts organized collaboratively by the larger research group, our main authors of reference are Freire, Gramsci, Anzaldua, Style, and Britzman. We also feature several finegained narratives that illuminate what we mean by "handlers of memory" in the educational setting.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Our shared philosophizing in this paper is a response to the concern that classroom teaching contributes to the deadening of curriculum as a source of meaning and an avenue for students and teachers to learn about themselves. In response, we propose the image of teachers as handlers of memory who work to cultivate and keep memories alive and central to learning. We recommend that teachers explore collective memory work (Haag, 1999) and reflective teaching narratives (Furman, 2015) as ways to get a handle on their own powerful memories of teaching.

ID SIMULATIONS
AB A growing literature highlights the benefits of playing the classic board game Diplomacy in international relations (IR) courses. But how exactly can it help students to learn not only about different IR theories, but also about what it means to use a theory in the first place? To address this question, I highlight my experiences overseeing the game during the first 2 weeks of seven introductory IR classes. Drawing from debriefing worksheets that 151 students completed after playing it, I examine whether they (1) made (implicit) connections to various theoretical perspectives and (2) developed a critical appreciation of theoretical abstraction and simplification. I find that the game's social and collaborative components lend themselves to theories beyond neorealism. More importantly, I show that by modeling rather than replicating world politics, Diplomacy introduces students to a counterintuitive idea: that theories can reveal things about reality even as they distort and omit parts of it. Moreover, having students reflect on the game's limitations encourages them to fill in the gaps, anticipate topics covered throughout the semester, and recognize the challenges of putting theories into practice.

AB As one of multiple ways to explore the reading process, eye movement miscue analysis is a tool that provides a continuous record of eye fixations and movements over an entire text, and a record of the oral reading of that text and the miscues (observed responses) that readers produce. The authors present profiles of two successful college readers who doubted their reading efficacy. Using data from eye tracking, miscue analysis, and the retelling, the authors invited the readers to examine their assumptions about reading and how they positioned themselves as readers. Data presented were drawn from the readers' eye movements during the reading of two texts-one an informational text and the other a constructed text with embedded errors-and are discussed in relation to the readers' perceptions of reader identity and processes. Implications for teachers include strategies for helping readers address common misconceptions about reading and reclaim their role as meaning makers.

AB Science should provide students an accurate and contemporary education on genetic influence, particularly how it impacts trait variability and developmental norms. Stories involving familial, racial, and sexual differences routinely appear in the popular media and sales of over-the-counter genetic tests are mounting. Unfortunately, research suggests genetic curricula in secondary education and university courses have little impact on genetic literacy; instead they appear to amplify genetic essentialism. This position paper reports on genetic essentialism, the impact of three components of science education (teachers, students, curriculum), and critiques existing genetic lessons in two prevalent scientific disciplines, biology and psychology. Two entrenched 19th century genetic paradigms (e.g., Mendelian inheritance and behavioral genetics) are specifically examined. The paper closes with specific recommendations for improving students' genetic literacy including important contemporary genetic science (e.g., epigenetics) and instructional approaches (e.g., learning progression, refutational teaching).

AB Policies toward undocumented immigrants have fueled political debates recently. Since policies are multidimensional, I proposed examining support for two types of policies: punishing or helping. The Theory of Dyadic Morality (Schein & Gray, 2018, https:// doi.org/10.1177/1088868317698288), above other theoretical approaches, was the most fitting to analyze these divergent perspectives. Based on the typecast model, I hypothesized that agent typecast beliefs would predict punishing and patient (victim) beliefs would predict helping. Thus, I expected the agent effect to be mediated through disgust and anger and the victim effect to be mediated through empathy-related emotions. In Study 1 participants provided open-ended responses regarding their beliefs about undocumented immigrants, which were coded for agent and victim themes. Viewing undocumented immigrants as agents of harm was associated with support for punishing policies, and this link was mediated by elevated disgust/anger. Study 2 replicated these Study 1 findings and, in addition, found that perceiving undocumented immigrants as victims was associated with support for helping policies. This link was mediated by increased empathy-related emotions. Implications for ongoing policy debates were discussed.

As these publications competed for business, they established and reiterated numerous claims regarding the authenticity of their images and news reports. Illustrators initially depicted African Americans using repurposed racial stereotypes that had existed for generations. Blackface minstrelsy, scientific racism, and racialized printed materials depicting African Americans are used as context to understand the images in the two illustrated newspapers.

AB The retention of students is a challenge faced by many universities in countries where participation rates are high. Living learning communities (LLCs) have been adopted by college administrators to increase retention, even though evidence of their effectiveness is largely anecdotal. This paper uses propensity score matching to address selection bias and identify the causal effect of an LLC program on GPA and retention. Survival analysis (of the matched sample) is used to estimate retention over time. Results suggest that the LLC program has a positive and lasting effect on retention and a positive impact on GPA in the earlier college years.

AB The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific's Smart Cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper, we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-savings achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional motion sensors, wires, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart, PASPORT (R) High Sensitivity Light Sensor, and the free SPARKvue (R) app by carrying out diffraction measurements of light with a single as well as double slit. Rylander and Miller reported a similar experiment but with an ordinary laboratory cart and a motion sensor to extract the precise position of the light sensor. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using a motion sensor and the laborious extraction of the position data.

AB Statistics is an important component of the knowledge base for health care professionals. In this essay, it is argued that statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT) should be considered an important component of their preparation as well. Health care professionals often must help others understand the statistical basis for recommendations they make. A COVID-19 press briefing is used to illustrate the need for SKT when making high-stakes recommendations related to public health. It is conjectured that efforts to educate the public during the press briefing would have been enhanced if the presenters had deeper knowledge of the general public's common statistical thinking patterns, the typical statistics curriculum experienced by members of their audience, and contemporary tools for teaching statistics. The importance of such knowledge to support smaller-scale individual interactions is also discussed. A call for SKT-centered partnerships between educational researchers and medical researchers is made; such partnerships could be mutually beneficial to the development of both fields and to society at large.

AB A hydrophilic ligand that contains only C, H, O, and N substituents and uses a 6,6 '-bis(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-2,2 '-bipyridine (BTzBP) structural core has been synthesized. The effect of adding water-soluble groups onto extractant ligands has been extensively studied to facilitate the efficient partitioning of 4f and transuranic 5f elements for the treatment of spent nuclear fuel. Soft, N-donor ligands exhibit greater binding affinities for the trivalent actinides over the trivalent lanthanides, making BTzBP ligands an ideal candidate in the search for extractants to be used on an industrial scale. To date, hydrophobic BTzBPs have been shown to exhibit physical and chemical properties that might be conducive to nuclear waste processing conditions. However, hydrophilic BTzBPs have yet to be reported. Herein, we show the synthesis of a hydrophilic BTzBP ligand featuring cationic water solubilizing groups attached to the bipyridal rings.

TI Robust Evolution in Historical Time
SO INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The normalized, deterministic conception of evolution espoused by Dennett is increasingly being challenged by theorists who, following Gould, emphasize the role that historical contingencies play in it. I explore the conflict between these views and argue that correcting our understanding of the relationship between nature's systematic necessities and historical temporality can resolve it. The mathematically precise laws science formulates describe the systematic patterns of nature abstractly and, as abstractions, these laws do not preclude but allow for the contingencies of historical time. Drawing on Heidegger and Hume, I argue that historical time is characterized by the ingression of the unprecedented future into the present. This is the ontological infrastructure that makes the evolution of unprecedented ontological alterities possible.

AB The change in enthalpy of a chemical reaction conducted at constant pressure is equal to the heat of the reaction plus the nonexpansion work of the reaction, Delta H = qP + w(additional). After deriving that relationship, most general and physical chemistry textbooks set w(additional) = 0 to arrive at the claim that Delta H = q(p), and nearly all further discussion of enthalpy assumes that Delta H = q(p). Setting w(additional) = 0 is viable for spontaneous reactions, but for non-spontaneous reactions, w(additional) not equal 0 as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, Delta H # q(p) for nonspontaneous reactions. Moreover, nonexpansion work is important for many interesting and important spontaneous reactions in biology (e.g., muscular movement, nerve signal transmission) and in modern society (e.g., batteries); incorporating w(additional) into Delta H allows for a more accurate discussion of the energy flow in these reactions. In this paper, I show that Delta H not equal qp for nonspontaneous reactions, and I discuss how Delta H must be partitioned between q(p), and w(additional) for several kinds of reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, I suggest how the discussion of enthalpy could be corrected in general and physical chemistry textbooks.

AB The intersection of ethics and diversity is central to our profession-yet it remains critically unexamined. This article seeks to fill this gap by suggesting the use of a new ethical deliberation heuristic: intersectional ethics. Grounded in intersectionality as a social theory and anti-oppressive practice, intersectional ethics utilizes six heuristic questions to consider positionality, social identity categories, dominant and non-dominant moral theories, professional mandates, and power. These questions are incremental and cumulative in nature; they are meant to engage and support anti-oppressive ethics, and to promote critical inquiry and reflexivity. Specific recommendations-including modules-are made for integrating the heuristic in social work ethics curriculum.

AB In Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist, Charles Brockden Brown explores foundational aesthetic complexes that inform his fitful attempts to express the emergent contours of an American poetics and politics of self-fashioning. Through the youthful figure of Carwin, Brown depicts how the nascent American artist's suffocating and repressed relationship with his patrimonial heritage provides the impetus for discovering and internalizing revolutionary, transformative, and subversive powers inherent in nature's hidden forms. Carwin's gradual, covert self-empowerment achieves expression not only through the agency of natural, local, and American forces but also through an allusive matrix connecting John Milton's A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) with William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Brown portrays Carwin's halting, and ultimately ineffectual, attempts to transform a poetics of imposture into a politics of subversion.

DT Article
ID CAGE,JOHN
AB This article elaborates the art-theoretical concept of 'the contemporary' along with formal differences between contemporary music and contemporary art. Contemporary art emerges from the radical transformations of the historical avant-garde and neo-avant-garde that have led to post-conceptual art - a generic art beyond specific mediums that prioritizes discursive meaning and social process - while contemporary music struggles with its status as a non-conceptual art form that inherits its concept from aesthetic modernism and absolute music. The article also considers the category of sound art and discusses some of the ways it, too, is at odds with contemporary art's generic and post-conceptual condition. I argue that, despite their respective claims to contemporaneity, neither sound art nor contemporary music is contemporary in the historical sense of the term articulated in art theory. As an alternative to these categories, I propose 'musical contemporary art' to describe practices that depart in consequential ways from new/contemporary music and sound art.

AB This paper discusses the practice of contemporary artist Cauleen Smith as an ongoing exploration of the aesthetic and political possibilities of cinematic space, place, and movement. Drawing upon a range of critical frameworks from cultural geography and Black feminism, it locates in Smith's work an aesthetics and politics of errantry that favors radically nonnormative forms of relation and mobility. Borrowing the term from Martinican novelist and critic Edouard Glissant, and drawing more broadly from his thoroughgoing elucidations of the spatial dynamics of colonialism, the plantation system, and their afterlives, the text frames Smith's cinematic errantry both as a formal and technological operation and as a political one grounded in a Black feminist praxis of place.

AB This paper investigates the impact of state ownership on the efficiency-equality tradeoff in a mixed economy with both state and nonstate sectors. Using overall capital productivity as an efficiency proxy and state output share as an inequality proxy, we identify the efficiency threshold of state capital share that splits the efficiency-equality relationship between a tradeoff and nontradeoff. When state capital share is greater than the threshold (as evidenced in the case of China), lowering state capital share improves efficiency and reduces inequality. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the threshold is sensitive to capital shares in output of the both sectors. A broad scope for mutual gains in efficiency and equality exists by raising the capital share in nonstate output and lowering the capital share in state output.

AB In Timebends, Miller discusses the "liberating' effect that seeing Streetcar had upon his own writing, and particularly upon that of Salesman. One of the effects of this liberation of language upon Miller's play is the incorporation into Salesman of plays on words that contribute substantially to the motifs and themes of the play. In this regard, "Word/Play" contributes to the ongoing interest in the careful and imaginative use of language in Salesman, which was neglected for so many years, by exploring comprehensively Miller's use of wordplay, essentially arguing that he employs the device to such an extent that recognizing its presence provides an additional key to the understanding of the play's many rich meanings.

TI Australia's Presidents? Herbert Hoover and Lyndon B. Johnson Remembered
SO AUSTRALIAN HISTORICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID COLD-WAR
AB Among US presidents, Herbert Hoover and Lyndon Johnson had the strongest ties to Australia. Hoover spent over a year in Australia as a mining engineer before launching a career in international business, food relief, and politics. In 1942, LBJ passed part of his pre-presidential career in Australia. Yet Johnson's presidential tour in 1966, coupled with his return in 1967, generated massive enthusiasm and modest protests against the Vietnam War. President Johnson's visits helped to solidify and celebrate US-Australian ties while encouraging Australian independence, even if during a war directed from Washington. While Hoover left his mark on Australia's landscape in the mines he promoted and the sites that still stand, Australians found little appealing in the dour, Depression-era president who had come and gone without regarding their country as a friend or ally. Johnson thus became a consequential figure in Australia's national history in ways Hoover never did.

AB This paper examines how an individual's labor supply responds immediately to her spouse's health shock in an aging household and how she adjusts her labor supply over time after her spouse's health shock. Different from previous work, this paper considers the subsequent health evolution following the spouse's health shock by proposing an adaptation model where the long-term labor supply adjustment of an individual is allowed to depend on her spouse's health evolution after the initial shock. Analysis of the 1996-2012 data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) suggests that in the short run, both husbands and wives change their labor supply very little when their spouses become ill, but in the long run, a husband's labor supply adjustment does vary with his wife's current health status after her initial health shock. In contrast, the wife's annual work hours are not affected by her husband's health shock in the long run, regardless of husband's subsequent health status. Households with an ill wife are probably at greater risk than those with an unhealthy husband in the long run, which may be attributed to the role that women have traditionally played in the household.

AB This paper examines the relationship between regulation-induced time delays and export entrepreneurship in a panel of 59 countries for the period 2006 to 2014. The paper finds robust evidence that regulations which cause lengthy time delays in moving a standard container of goods from the factory to the seaport significantly reduce export entry rate. These findings support the hypothesis that decreasing regulation-induced time delays expands export entrepreneurship by reducing the cost of exporting. Additionally, the paper finds that superior quality institutions significantly enhance the positive impact of lower regulatory time barriers on export entrepreneurship. Stronger protection of private property rights is the most important measure of institutional quality that aides the favorable impact of lower regulation-induced time barriers on export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation-induced time barriers has a positive effect on net entry rate and survival rates of export entrants, and high-quality institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive outcome.

ID EDUCATION
AB The study explores how literacy sponsorship (Brandt, 2001) is constructed in a United States rural region by focusing on the discourse of rural teachers and students. Data included interviews with teachers and students, classroom observations, an environmental print literacy scan, and analysis of community and classroom-based texts. A multi-cycle coding approach was used to develop thematic findings. Overall, the findings demonstrate that schooling and teachers serve as the recognized literacy sponsors in the community while the role of parents as active literacy sponsors and place-based literacies went unrecognized. Two aspects of sponsorship were apparent: 1) the value of interpersonal relationships and 2) the adherence to normative, placeless English language arts curricula. Instead of seeking out local texts, participants demonstrated their professionalism as stewards of the educational trust enacted in these communities which does not accommodate critical perspectives. Implications for literacy educators include the need for the larger community of critical literacy educators to addresses rural learners as central to our collective work at both the policy and research level.

AB This study examines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers' practices in the treatment of their breast cancer survivor (BCS) clients and interprets these practices within the context of existing neuroscientific research on the mirror neuron system (MNS). Purposive and snowball sampling was conducted to recruit CAM providers (N = 15) treating BCSs from integrative medicine centers, educational institutions, private practices, and professional medical associations across the United States. In-depth semi-structured interviewing (N = 252 single-spaced pages) and inductive qualitative content analysis reveal CAM therapeutic practices emphasize a diachronic form of mimetic self-reflexivity and a serendipitous form of mimetic intersubjectivity in BCS pain management to allow the providers to tune-in to their clients' internal states over time and experience themselves as an embodied subject in an imaginative, shared space. By employing imagination and an intentional vulnerability in their embodied simulation of the others' internal states, CAM providers co-create experiences of pain while recognizing what about the other remains an unknown. Although MNs provide the mechanism for imitation and simulation underlying empathy through a neuronally wired grasp of the other's intentionality, the study suggests that examining mimetic self-reflexivity and intersubjectivity in the therapeutic space may allow for a shared simulation of participants' subjective experiences of pain and potentially inform research on self-recognition and self-other discrimination as an index of self-awareness which implicates the MNS in embodied social cognition in imaginative ways.

SO MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL

DE Probability; SOLO taxonomy; Cognition; Beliefs
ID RANDOMNESS; FRAMEWORK; CHILDREN
AB The role of probability in curricula for children has fluctuated greatly over the past several decades. Recently, some countries have removed probability from their preschool and primary curricula, and others have retained it. One reason for such lack of agreement is that theory about early probability learning is still relatively new and under development. The purpose of this report is to sketch a tentative theoretical structure with the potential to anchor curricular decisions and inform further research on early probability learning. Toward that end, we begin by reviewing existing literature. We attend, in particular, to the probabilistic thinking tendencies exhibited by children whom researchers consider to be in the earliest stages of learning the subject. We then use these tendencies to posit two different cycles for early probabilistic thinking. One of these cycles is compatible with disciplinary norms and supports normative thinking; thinking tendencies in this normative compatible cycle include attending to the position of objects in a container, forming images of random generators, attending to the operation of random generators, and thinking about past experiences playing games of chance. Thinking tendencies in the other posited cycle lead to belief systems that conflict with normative disciplinary practice; these belief systems include elements such as myths, superstitions, animism, and determinism. We illustrate the two cycles using empirical data from design-based research. We then reflect on how the two cycles comprising our structure of early probabilistic thinking (SEPT) framework can provide a basis for further curricular and theoretical work.

ID EXPERIENCES
AB Lower sexual satisfaction with one's current partner (SSCP) has been associated with having a history of sexual victimization experience (SVE). However, whether or not this SVE involved the current partner as the perpetrator has been unclear. This study aimed to address this gap in the sexual health literature by examining women's SSCP based on SVE with that current partner (yes; no) and/or a different perpetrator (yes; no). A convenience sample of undergraduate women with an exclusive current partner (n = 412; 99 percent unmarried) at a U.S. public university anonymously responded via paper-and-pencil to the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization between 2012-2016. A 2 x 2 ANOVA revealed that current-partner SVE was associated with lower SSCP (F (1, 410) = 7.38, p = .007, partial n2 = .018), but other-perpetrator SVE was not. SVE may predict lower SSCP when victimized by that partner, as that partner may be associated with the negative victimization experience. Although preliminary, findings highlight the importance of considering how partner-related health factors (e.g. SSCP) may be differentially associated with SVE based on whether or not the victim's current partner was the perpetrator.

AB This paper examines the relationship between natural resource rents and new business formation (a critical measure of entrepreneurship) using a panel dataset of 28 African countries covering the period 2002-2014. The paper finds robust evidence that nations with high resource rents (i.e., resource rents exceeding 30% of GDP) significantly exhibit less entrepreneurial activity. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that high resource rents significantly promote rent-seeking behavior at the expense of entrepreneurship. Policies that reward productive entrepreneurship and reduce incentives for rent-seeking behavior are therefore important for reversing this negative relationship in African countries with high natural resource-derived income.

AB The announcement of one's candidacy for the presidency sets the stage for everything that will follow in the campaign. This study analyzes candidate announcements from the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president and how each of the top six candidates branded themselves. The campaign announcement is the first opportunity to shape the brand of the candidate in a crowded field of candidates. Comparisons will be made between candidates with national name recognition and those who have yet to make a name for themselves on a national stage. For more well-known candidates, this address is meant to energize supporters and build momentum toward the nomination. Well-known candidates may be able to more clearly form a branding around policy positions. For the lesser-known candidates, it is a chance to introduce themselves to the nation and begin to build a following. These speakers may present a more personal narrative to brand themselves as an individual before presenting policy. A comparison will also be made between male and female candidates, including an analysis of gendered language in announcing their candidacy.

AB As of 2018, there were more than 44.7 million immigrants residing, both lawfully and unlawfully, in the United States [Batalova, J., Blizzard, B., & Bolter, J. (2020, February 14). Frequently requested statistics on immigrants and immigration in the United States. Migration Policy Institute. ]. Understanding the attitudes of U.S. citizens towards immigrants is necessary because of the impact that attitudes can have on policy development and the subsequent national treatment of immigrants based on those policies. This article utilizes a framework of national identity which suggests that this construct is comprised of three separate elements: nativism, emotionality, and behavior. Using U.S. citizen response data from three waves of the National Identity module of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) from 1995, 2003, and 2013, multivariate linear regressions were used to explore the relationship between this framework and attitudes towards immigrants. Findings indicated that there were statistically significant relationships between respondents' perceptions of national identity and attitudes towards immigrants.

AB Almost no research exists examining the relationship between body-esteem and sexual victimization experience in adulthood. The current study contributes to the literature by examining body-esteem based on type of sexual victimization experience (i.e., none, sexual contact, attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, rape). Participants included undergraduate women (n = 750) who completed the Body-Esteem Scale (Franzoi & Shields, 1984) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (Koss et al., 2007), and had either no history of sexual victimization experience or experience within the past year. Women with no sexual victimization experience did not differ from women with sexual contact experience, but both groups reported higher body-esteem than women with coercion, attempted coercion, and rape experience. These three latter groups did not differ from one another, but each reported lower body-esteem than women with attempted rape experience, who reported higher body-esteem than those with no experience. Findings are preliminary but suggest that body-esteem may be negatively associated with some types of sexual victimization experience (attempted and completed coercion, rape), but not others (sexual contact, attempted rape), and escaping rape may increase positive feelings toward one's body.

AB Divine providence, as traditionally conceived, keeps historical time subordinate to God's sovereignty so that the divine plan for it is fulfilled. This article argues that the starting point for theologizing about providence ought to be the logic of radical generosity in play when the divine Thou creates historical time as a reality unto itself by giving it an unprecedented future. Providence does not protect the historically conditioned universe from this future; it draws the universe into it. The human experience of grace offers us a paradigmatic example of this.

AB Players entering the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) are allocated to teams based on a draft where lower performing teams in the regular season earn the highest odds of selecting the best players, creating an incentive for teams to lose games. Using data from the 2000-2019 seasons, results indicate that WNBA teams are more likely to lose after they have been eliminated from postseason playoffs regardless of the gender of the coach or general manager. Evidence of tanking is concentrated in seasons after the WNBA made a draft lottery change in 2015, which was intended to reduce tanking.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a rapidly growing global public health problem. It causes premature loss of lives, the interruption of workforce supply pipelines, increased care demand for injured elderly people, and other socio-economic burdens. This paper presents the importance of and the need for a national comprehensive TBI database that incorporates geospatial data components to help tackle the TBI epidemic. It calls for legislative and research actions to enhance the U.S. TBI data infrastructure to make the use of GIS in TBI research possible. Further, it proposes a multi-tiered conceptual framework and associated implementation strategy to establish the proposed national TBI data structure. The enhanced U.S. TBI data infrastructure will provide a feasible platform to utilize the GIS capabilities for location-based mapping, data analysis and modelling. Precision TBI research, targeted outreach, and education will likely facilitate more effective prevention and better care delivery. The enhanced U.S. TBI database infrastructure will serve as a guiding model for other developing nations. Global concerted efforts on TBI can help improve the overall quality of living around the world.

AB This paper examines the impact of startup regulations and institutional quality on the level of new business activity in a panel of 119 countries between 2001 and 2012. We find robust evidence that new business creation is significantly lower in countries with excessive barriers to entry, a lack of high-quality governmental institutions, or both. Specifically, increasing by one, the number of steps required to start a new business, reduces entrepreneurial activity between 3 and 7%. Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in the overall average level of institutional quality is associated with a 34% increase in new business activity.

AB Blending narrative portraiture and feminist methods, this study explored the lives of two rural women who are creative writers. The study asked (1) What are their critical purposes? and (2) How did gender and place intersect in their writing lives? The findings were that the women used creative writing to engage in praxis by creating and disseminating knowledge. Their writing critically interrogated and redefined conceptions of womanhood. Additional critical purposes were unique to women's intersectional identities and lived experiences. They ranged from interrogating societal perspectives of gender, sexuality, and race to interrogating rurality and sexual violence. The aesthetic texts they created articulated and advocated for intersubjective truths. Shifting the focus of critical literacy from pedagogy and reading to writing beyond educational spaces, the women drew upon critical literacy not as a means of being taught how to understand the power of texts, but to wield the power of texts themselves.

AB Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with 20% of deaths in adults under age 65. Commercial drivers have an increased CVD incidence rate of 50% compared to 30% for the general population, yet one third of drivers will not be screened for risk factors due to a lack of insurance or primary care. With approximately 3.5 million commercial drivers nationally and correlation of CVD to increased motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and excessive healthcare costs, addressing the care gap for this high-risk population is imperative. Methods: An evidence-based practice (EBP) project synthesized the literature and implemented CVD risk screening for commercial drivers examined in an occupational practice setting. Using the non-laboratory Framingham CVD risk score calculator, over 90% of drivers were screened during mandated medical examinations and provided education regarding modifiable risk factors during a 2-month period. Findings: Over 40% of commercial drivers were at high risk for CVD with 25% uninsured and 32% without primary care. The average CVD risk score was twice the general population's risk score, with obesity, hypertension, and smoking being the most common risk factors discussed. Conclusions/Application to Practice: Incorporating CVD risk screening and education during opportune encounters is logical, efficient, and financially prudent. The EBP change supports occupational professionals' standards, and ongoing review of CVD screening guidelines with integration into practice provides health promotion and promotes public safety for these essential workers.

AB Background: Parents of children with developmental disabilities experience greater stress and worse mental and physical health outcomes than parents of typically developing children. The use of various humor styles to cope with stressors has been associated with mental and, to a lesser extent, physical health outcomes in other populations, but has not been previously examined among parents of children with disabilities.
   Aims: To examine relations of adaptive vs. maladaptive humor styles with depression, daily affect, mental and physical functioning, somatic symptoms, and health behaviors, and to examine whether social support or positive reappraisal mediate relations of humor with health outcomes.
   Method: 80 parents of children with disabilities completed online surveys at T1. 40 parents completed T2 surveys 4 months later.
   Results: As predicted, the adaptive humor styles - self-enhancing and affiliative - were associated with enhanced mental health outcomes, and these relations were mediated by social support and, to a lesser extent, positive reappraisal. Self-defeating humor was associated with worse mental health, greater symptoms, and worse health behavior; these relations were mediated by social support.
   Conclusion: Adaptive humor use may facilitate caregivers' ability to garner support from others and reframe stressors, which ultimately may contribute to mental and physical resilience to stress.

DE rape empathy; victimization; perpetration; gender
ID VICTIMS
AB The purpose of this study was to examine empathy with a hypothetical rape victim and rapist based on sexual victimization experience and/or sexual perpetration experience, and participant gender. Undergraduates (n = 531; 385 female) completed the Rape-Victim and Rape-Perpetrator Empathy Scales (Smith and Frieze2003) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization and Perpetration (Koss et al.2007). Participants were categorized into four sexual aggression experience groups, which included "nonexperienced" (n = 220; 129 female), "victimization-only" (n = 206; 185 female), "perpetration-only" (n = 8; 2 female), and "overlapping" (both victimization and perpetration experience,n = 42; 25 female). The majority of those with perpetration experience also reported victimization experience (overlapping experience; 84%), and the perpetration-only group was too small to test. Those with victimization-only experience reported greater empathy with a rape victim than those with overlapping experience and those nonexperienced, but the latter two groups did not differ. No differences were found among these three groups for empathy with a rapist. Women reported greater empathy with a rape victim, and lesser empathy with a rapist, than men. Those nonexperienced and with overlapping experience may not be able to take the perspective of and empathize with a rape victim to the same extent as those with victimization-only experience, perhaps due to less similarity in experience. Future researchers should consider those with overlapping sexual aggression experience as distinct from those with victimization-only or perpetration-only experience.

AB This paper examines the determinants of retention and GPA for a large population of students enrolled at a U.S. public four-year university. Using a Heckman selection model to correct for sample selection bias, we find that cognitive factors positively relate to GPA over the college career and that non-cognitive factors have a stronger association in earlier semesters. These results suggest that policy to increase retention should focus on building community, whereas policy to improve academic achievement should focus on developing the perseverance required to build study skills in the early college years.

AB Testing the hypothesis that the resource curse promotes rent-seeking behaviour at the expense of entrepreneurship, we examine the relationship between natural resource rents and new business creation using a panel of 116 countries spanning the period 2001-2012. We find that nations with heavy natural resource extraction exhibit less entrepreneurial activity, but this negative relationship is greatly reduced and even reversed in nations possessing a threshold level of governance quality. Unfortunately, the group of nations exceeding this threshold consists primarily of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members. These results support the hypothesis that the resource curse, when left unchecked by weak institutions, promotes rent-seeking behaviour that harms entrepreneurship. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Entrepreneurship is at the heart of new developments that often lead to the creation of new industries. This study examines the origins of the canning industry via the experiences of three of its earliest entrepreneurs: Edward Wright, William Numsen, and Thomas Kensett II. The narrative examines key aspects of the industry's context including the growth in demand for preserved foods, the resources of the Chesapeake region, and the development of food preservation technology. Using the five characteristics of entrepreneurial processes, the importance of entrepreneurs in the development of the economic growth of Baltimore's early canning industry is examined. Each founder exhibited entrepreneurial characteristics in different ways. One failed in his efforts; the other two succeeded in developing businesses that endured into the next century. The study reveals that using entrepreneurial processes does not guarantee success, and that there are various paths to success. An entrepreneurial multiplier effect was also evident in the growth of firms producing supplies and equipment for canners. Using an entrepreneurial lens offers a closer insight into the development of firms and their industries. Some remaining unanswered questions as well as avenues for future studies are discussed.

AB Property O for an arbitrary complex, Fano manifold X is a statement about the eigenvalues of the linear operator obtained from the quantum multiplication of the anticanonical class of X. Conjecture O is a conjecture that property O holds for any Fano variety. Pasquier classified the smooth nonhomogeneous horospherical varieties of Picard rank 1 into five classes. Conjecture O has already been shown to hold for the odd symplectic Grassmannians, which is one of these classes. We will show that conjecture O holds for two more classes and an example in a third class of Pasquier's list. Perron-Frobenius theory reduces our proofs to be graph-theoretic in nature.

AB Economists largely agree that writing is fundamental to understanding and communicating economics and can serve as an effective way to teach students to "think like economists." However, only a small percentage of programs include writing-intensive courses, a major research paper, or a senior thesis, and even fewer devote class time to the writing process. This article provides a multi-dimensional classification of process-based writing assignments that are categorized according to two criteria: writing skill and economic understanding, and outlines how economists can use these approaches in a range of economic courses that do and do not include a research paper.

AB Background Temporality is understood as the subjective perception of the flow of chronological time and is a central component of contemporary and integrative medicine approaches. Although temporal dynamics are recognized as central to the processes associated with chronic pain (CP), the temporal management of CP is inadequately understood in pain research.Research question How is temporality conceptualized in Ayurvedic protocols of CP management?.Method Ayurvedic physicians (N = 10) from India were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. A semi-structured interview protocol was employed to gather qualitative data focusing on the Ayurvedic protocol employed to treat CP patients. The interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Member validation, participant voice, and researcher self-awareness were employed to strengthen reliability and validity.Findings An ontologically grounded thematic exploration of Ayurvedic protocols illustrates that temporality is conceptualized in CP as spatiotemporal present moment awareness (PMA) and embodied time (ET). Spatiotemporality as PMA references an awareness of the relationality of cognitive temporal movement, dosha operations, and their pathophysiological expression in the body. Spatiotemporality as ET is conceptualized as awareness of the expression of time in embodied emotional and psychosocial processes as in the movement of the breath through the body, the movement of body sensations over time, and in their intersection with consciousness.Discussion The study findings present an experiential and relational framework situating spatiotemporality ontologically as an organizing principle in CP management. While temporality focuses on the representation of experiences and relations over time, spatiotemporality foregrounds a constructionist approach by centering the embodied spatial cognitive expression of time, consciousness, and subjective experience.

ID HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS; ENGLISH; CLASSROOM; TEACHERS; WRITERS
AB Drawing on critical theories of labor and commodification, this qualitative embedded case study explores how students experience alienation and intimacy in the work of writing for an English language arts class. Analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and the teacher illuminated the meaningful assemblages where conditions of intimacy permeated instruction. Two practices supported intimacy in working conditions: knowledge about writing built through a collective process of noticing, and open-ended work time characterized by "managed nonmanagement" (Tsing, 2015, p. 176), or calculated flexibility in rules and expectations. Findings illustrate how a literacy practice might contribute to students' experience of alienation or intimacy (or both) while writing, depending on conditions of industrialization and commodification. Even as the teacher strove to deindustrialize work, commodification through grades and standardized assessments heightened alienation in the writing environment. The study provides an example of an educational context governed by an industrial system of assessment where local actors (the teacher and students) disrupted alienation by working in smaller scales and more closely with texts.

AB Purpose Drawing on the literature regarding gender, marital status and homeownership, this paper aims to examine the role of gender and marital status played in homeownership in urban China. This paper also attempted to shed light on other determinants of homeownership as well as heterogeneity in the factors related to homeownership between never married women and never married men. Design/methodology/approach This study uses data from the 2010 to 2015 China General Social Survey to investigate factors related to homeownership among urban Chinese households and focuses on the role of gender and marital status in particular. Multivariate analyses were applied to the full sample, never married sample, never married women sample and never married men sample respectively. Findings Findings from this study on the full sample showed that never married individuals were less likely to be the homeowners compared to the married couples. The probability of homeownership of never married women was lower compared to the never married men cohort. Different personal characteristics contributed to homeownership between never married women and never married men cohort. Research limitations/implications The empirical model in this study did not provide direct evidence that never married individuals were more likely to be homeowners as reflected in the recent mass media news. Further study could conduct a survey designed specifically for this group. Originality/value This study adds to current literature with further understanding of factors related to homeownership among Chinese households in general as well as in never married women and never married men subsamples.

DE self-esteem; verbal; coercion; sexual experiences survey
ID VICTIMIZATION; AGGRESSION; RAPE; SAMPLE
AB Verbal coercion experience is common among college women and has sometimes been associated with lower self-esteem. The current study examined self-esteem based on the two verbal coercion items included in the latest version of the most popular measure of sexual victimization experience, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV; Koss et al.,2007). One item includes verbal tactics categorized as "threat" and the other item includes verbal tactics categorized as "criticism." Undergraduate women (n = 479) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV. Results showed that women who experienced criticism reported lower self-esteem than those who did not experience criticism. However, threat experience was not significantly related to women's self-esteem. Findings support Koss et al.'s suggestion that criticism tactics are more negative than threat tactics, and imply that self-esteem may be negatively associated with some sexually coercive verbal tactics but not associated with others. Future researchers should pay careful attention to operational definitions of verbal coercion.

ID ARGUMENTATION; MATHEMATICS
AB Learning to interpret data in context is an important educational outcome. To assess students' attainment of this outcome, it is necessary to examine the interplay between their contextual and statistical reasoning. We describe a research method designed to do so. The method draws upon Toulmin's (1958, 2003) model of argumentation for the first stage of qualitative data analysis and the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) (Biggs & Collis, 1991) model for the second stage. Toulmin analyses help identify the justifications and expressions of uncertainty students provide in their interpretive arguments. Subsequent analyses based on the multi-modal conceptualization of SOLO help characterize the quality of student arguments relative to one another. Existing literature and an empirical example are drawn upon to explain how the Toulmin and SOLO models can be used in tandem to analyze students' interpretations of contextualized data. We also explain how pairing Toulmin and SOLO can address theoretical and practical limitations that arise when using just one of the two models on its own.

AB The cost of textbooks is problematic for many students at American colleges as prices have increased by 140% in almost two decades (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). This economic injustice causes students to miss out on educational opportunities because they have to prioritize paying for their basic needs over textbooks. This article discusses a research study which explored students' perceptions of using an Open/Alternative Educational Resource (OAER), specifically a nontraditional textbook in a social work skills course. Overall, results support the notion that students are amenable to buying a low cost, nontraditional textbook option.

AB In the context of the Great Challenges for Social Work, this conceptual paper envisions a "radical imaginary" as a call to action to incrementally build an epistemically just ethics infrastructure in the coming decade that centers race, ethnicity, and culture. The existing challenges of the dominance of moral absolutes and Eurocentric ethics curriculum were examined. Three change processes were proposed to help build a futuristic infrastructure for ethics praxis with a thicker, more equitable, and more inclusive moral social fabric. This "radical imaginary" promotes anti-racist and anti-oppressive ethics praxis that seeks to eliminate both ethical social isolation and ethics-based racism.

AB The introduction of the Wireless Smart Cart by PASCO scientific in April 2016 has ushered in a paradigm shift in the design and implementation of low-cost undergraduate physics and engineering laboratory experiments. The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. The smart cart in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for smartphones by carrying out an experiment on damped oscillations.

AB In the early 2000s, the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public School system implemented district-wide changes to funding, curriculum, staffing, and technology. Using data from 1995 to 2014, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that the reforms significantly increased the percentage of students in Montgomery County who scored advanced on third- and fifth-grade math and reading tests. Using an event study strategy, we find that the positive impacts extended through the end of the panel. Our results contribute to the literature on school reform by finding positive impacts of school reform in a district that was high performing prior to reforms.

DT Article
DE Emotions; Embodiment; Teacher identity; Collective memory work
AB Purpose This paper aims to engage nine women English teachers in exploring their personal memories centered around the perception of their raced, classed and gendered teacher bodies, and led them to conceptualize teaching as invasion. Design/methodology/approach The process of collective memory work (CMW), a qualitative feminist research method, was used to structure collaborative sessions for the nine women English teachers. In these sessions, the group took up the CMW process as the memories were written, read, analyzed and theorized together. Findings The analyses of two memories from our group's work builds understanding of how the use of new materialism and a conceptualization of emotions as social, collective and agentic, can expand the understanding of the teacher bodies and disrupt normalizing narratives of teaching and learning. The post-humanist concept of intra-action leads one to better understand the boundaries in the teacher - student relationships that is built/invaded, and to see the ways materials, humans, emotions and discourses are entangled in the teaching encounters. Originality/value This study demonstrates how sustained and collective research methodologies like CMW can open space for teachers to more fully explore their identities, encounters and relationships. Further, unpacking everyday classroom moments (through the framework of literacy-as-event) can yield deep and critical understanding of how bodies, emotions and non-human objects all become entangled when teaching becomes an act of invasion.

TI The presidents club revisited: Herbert Hoover, Lyndon Johnson, and the
   politics of legacy and bipartisanship
SO HISTORIAN
LA English
DT Article
DE Herbert Hoover; Lyndon Johnson; politics; bipartisanship
AB On the surface, the association between Lyndon Johnson, an erstwhile New Dealer, and Herbert Hoover, FDR's bete noire, would seem unlikely. Its existence underscores the complex interplay between presidents, challenging sentimental talk of a "Presidents Club" among Oval Office occupants. No rules of behavior among presidents prevail, as Donald J. Trump's attacks on his immediate predecessors revealed. And undue emphasis on a "Presidents Club" privileges comity and commonality - of customs, manners, activities, and even aims - over intricacy and singularity, that is, how and why a distinct relationship between two presidents forms, evolves, strengthens, or weakens. Johnson and Hoover, for their part, collaborated in a rather formal fashion and out of self-interest, a degree of personal regard, and respect for the institution they both had headed.
   Personal, political, and institutional factors drew Hoover and Johnson together. Both presidents rose from modest circumstances, entered public service, and sought to help poor people: Hoover through private channels, LBJ via public action. Both had experience working across party lines, and they respected the office they once had held. The Johnson-Hoover interaction, at its core, entwined the politics of legacy and the politics of bipartisanship. Hoover cultivated politicians in both parties in order to regain his relevance and reputation. Johnson courted Hoover and honored his memory in order to present himself as above routine politics and to treat his predecessor with the consideration he longed for. Neither man gained all they sought from this association.

AB BACKGROUND: Resistance exercise provides an effective stimulus for improving the metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle, and the type of acute muscle contraction plays an important role in determining specific responses and adaptations. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the effect of contraction order on metabolic responses by comparing monophasic concentric and eccentric squats versus a protocol incorporating alternated concentric and eccentric repetitions.
   METHODS: Twelve recreationally active men (21.1 +/- 1.1yr) performed three nearly identical squat protocols on separate days. Protocols varied only with contraction-type, including 4 sets x 10 reps concentric-only (CON), eccentric-only (ECC), and BOTH which alternated 5 concentric followed by 5 eccentric reps (CON-ECC; sets 1 and 3) and vice versa (ECC-CON; sets 2 and 4). The experimental trials were performed once weekly in a randomized, counter-balanced order, and expired gases were collected using a two-way non-rebreathing mask and oxygen consump-tion quantified with indirect calorimetry. Subjects raised (CON) and lowered (ECC) the load in 2s, and all sets (2 min) and repetitions (8 s) were separated by standardized rest intervals.
   RESULTS: From the BOTH protocol, the increase in metabolic rate was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during squats performed with CON-ECC order (0.60 +/- 0.11 L.min(-1)) compared to ECC-CON (0.44 +/- 0.07 L.min(-1)), but excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) was opposite, with significantly greater metabolic rate during the 2-minute rest intervals after ECC-CON squats (0.46 +/- 0.09 L.min(-1)) compared to CON-ECC (0.25 +/- 0.05 L.min(-1)). Metabolic rates during and after squats were significantly greater (P <= 0.05) with CON (0.63 +/- 0.09; 0.49 +/- 0.10 L.min(-1)) compared to ECC (0.34 +/- 0.04; 0.20 +/- 0.04 L.min(-1)), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data present an interesting paradigm regarding the contraction-dependent metabolic responses to monophasic resis-tance exercise and suggest a greater EPOC following concentric versus eccentric muscle actions.

AB Werner, TJ, Pellinger, TK, Rosette, VD, and Ortlip, AT. Effects of a 12-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness: a randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 35(12): 3281-3287, 2021-Arterial stiffness is an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Some reports indicate that resistance training increases indices of arterial stiffness, whereas others report no association. This study sought to determine the association between 2 common resistance training models and indices of arterial stiffness. We recruited 30 male, untrained subjects (18-30 years) and randomized them into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON, n = 10), high-intensity resistance exercise (HI, n = 10), and high-volume resistance exercise (HV, n = 10). Subjects randomized to the resistance training groups were required to perform whole-body strength training exercises 3-5 days a week for 12 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50-70% of 1RM) for the HV group. Anthropometry, carotid artery diameters, peripheral and central blood pressure, and maximal dynamic strength were measured before and after the 12-week study period. Subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet and avoid aerobic exercise during the study. After the intervention, both the HI and HV groups increased their maximal strength on the back squat, bench press, and seated row (all p < 0.05). However, there were no changes in arterial stiffness indices between the groups. Using a randomized controlled trial with validated measurements of arterial stiffness, chronic resistance training does not appear to influence central arterial stiffness, regardless of training volume and load.

Undergraduate women (n = 1,005) completed the Body-Esteem Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Sexual Experiences Survey. Women raped within the past year (recently) reported lower levels of both body-esteem and self-esteem than those raped over a year ago (earlier) and nonvictims, but women raped earlier did not differ from nonvictims. Rape labeling status was not significant. Findings identify lower body-esteem, in addition to lower self-esteem, as correlates of recent rape.

AB We investigated ant species richness and abundance of the maritime forest and dune habitats of Assateague Island, a barrier island off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. We paired 5 transects of 100 m in forest habitats with 5 transects in dune and grassland habitats, with pitfall traps set every 10 m along each transect. During a 5-month period (May-September). we collected 26 species of ants, including 9 that had not been previously recorded on the island and 2 that had never been recorded east of Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. Forest habitats had a significantly higher species richness than the dunes, with 24 and 14 species collected, respectively. Our research provides baseline data on ant species richness for this temperate barrier island using pitfall-collection methods. We provide evidence for forest habitats supporting higher species richness and make suggestions for future research.

ID HEALTH
AB Due to systemic racialized homophobia and transphobia, Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people continue to experience worse life outcomes in comparison to both their Black cisgender and heterosexual, and White LGBTQ+ counterparts. Community psychologists have the tools and training to address these disparities. Using a critical whiteness studies lens, we draw on qualitative data with 17 White LGBTQ+ people to describe how white supremacy manifests in LGBTQ+ spaces. Our research indicates White LGBTQ+ people want to create intersectional spaces but lack the necessary skills to effectively confront anti-Black racism. This resulted in actions which upheld and reinforced white supremacy, despite stated commitments to Black LGBTQ+ liberation. We conclude with recommendations for community psychologists, including engaging in intersectional coalition-building, training centered around queer critical race theory, working to address racialized homophobia and transphobia alongside existing efforts to deconstruct anti-Black racism within community psychology, and consciousness-raising work with White people involved in LGBTQ+ equality movements to dismantle white supremacist structures within their organizations.

AB Purpose The academic literature on emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs) has classified several strategic options that EMNCs can adopt as part of their internationalization process. Although this research stream does include examples of Indian companies, it has not adequately identified specific strategic practices followed by them as part of their internationalization process. Therefore, this article aims to identify specific firm competencies, home country advantages and strategic practices that Indian EMNCs adopt to achieve foreign market entry and internationalization. Design/methodology/approach The article adopts a multiple case study methodology supported by unstructured interviews to answer the research question. Using a combination of in-depth interviews and secondary data related to the case study in question, strategic practices of three Indian companies operating in different industry segments are identified and evaluated. Findings The results highlight that as part of their internationalization process, EMNCs from India adopt a combination of strategic practices that include strategic alliances, acquisitions, entry into targeted geographic markets, localized and innovative product offerings and niche market focus. This mix of strategic practices, in combination with high levels of corporate parenting, plays an important role in the ability of Indian EMNCs to internationalize successfully. Originality/value This study contributes to the international business field by developing a better understanding of the internationalization process followed by emerging market multinational firms. In addition, as the article adopts a case study approach, specific business strategies adopted by Indian firms as part of their internationalization process are identified. The study, therefore, provides a strategic roadmap for firms from emerging countries on how to internationalize successfully.

AB Mobile payment technology platforms are quickly gaining popularity. Despite this growth, academic research offers little insight into how adopting mobile payment technology impacts firm value. Further, extant studies are silent on the factors that determine the outcome of pursuing this strategy. Results from an event study of 152 announcements of mobile payments show an increase in firm value by an average of 1.03%, highlighting their effectiveness. Further analysis reveals characteristics of mobile payments that can augment this change in firm value. Specifically, positive firm value accrues when retailers promote the use of mobile payments to their customers. The authors also find that, compared with retailers whose target market comprises older customers, retailers targeting younger customers benefit more from adopting mobile payments. Finally, this study reveals an early-mover advantage, which is maximized in conjunction with an expansive, national rollout strategy. In fact, although a national rollout can be more beneficial early, the results show that for retailers that adopt mobile payments later, there is no difference between using an expansive rollout or a more limited, phased rollout strategy.

DT Article
ID NURSE FACULTY; ISSUES
AB Background: Recruitment and retention of new clinical educators is of urgent concern as it coincides with a growing need for qualified RNs. One solution is to provide intensive training experiences for expert clinicians who can become educators. Method: This mixed-method research reports on 10-year outcomes of one hybrid program and the improvements made to align with best practices in learning in an online environment. Results: From 2012 to 2021, a total of 264 participants completed the program, with 71% taking teaching positions in 21 of 26 Maryland nursing programs. Aggregate data from surveys and focus groups revealed a need for improvements in the organization of program materials, strategies to help participants manage the program's pace, and further efforts to create an ongoing sense of community. Conclusion: In the past 10 years, the Faculty Academy and Mentorship Initiative cians for educator roles while using data to drive change and improve the participant experience

ID NEW-JERSEY
AB The COVID-19 pandemic forced many public health professionals to take on new roles such as online teaching, communicating, and managing; serving on the frontlines of patient care; and serving as health education resource personnel. Researchers of this study posed the question: How has the pandemic impacted those who serve to help others? Seven aspects of self-efficacy in professional practice were examined via an online survey sent to health educators. Respondents were extremely confident communicating with their colleagues and supervisors (60%) and with students (51%), but only 19% were extremely confident in maintaining a work-life balance and 22% in managing personal and professional stress. Respondents reported being confident in all areas of responsibilities, overall, but they were most confident in Area 8 (ethics and professionalism) and least confident in Area 1 (assessing the needs and capacity of a community) since COVID-19. Findings imply a need for more professional development opportunities to foster professional and personal self-efficacy and to improve self-efficacy in needs assessment, leadership, and advocacy. Findings also show a need for workplace or state-based interventions to support resiliency and self-care among professionals who work to serve others.

AB On the basis of the self-determination theory, we develop and test an integrative framework that explains when and why customer incivility impairs employee service performance. Using multisource data collected through two waves in a shopping mall, we found that the strength of the mediated relationship between customer incivility and employee service performance (via employee intrinsic motivation) varied based on employee core-self evaluations; the negative indirect effect of customer incivility via intrinsic motivation on service performance was weaker for employees with high levels of core-self evaluations than for employees with low levels of core-self evaluations.

AB Within the last decade, research has focussed on corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices as a strategic tool that enables firms to improve stakeholder perception, brand image and corporate reputation. However, one area that remains understudied is the role played by CSR practices in managing corporate reputation under conditions of supply chain risk. To answer this research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using quantitative analysis of both primary and secondary data collected from organizations dispersed globally. The results highlight that under conditions of supply chain network disruption risk, CSR practices play an important role in enabling firms to manage the negative impact of such risk drivers on corporate reputation. The study further suggests that CSR practices positively impact supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and are a necessary condition for SCRM practices to be effective in improving corporate reputation of organizations.

AB Beta regression models are commonly used in the case of a dependent variableythat exists on the range (0,1). However, whenycan additionally take on the values of zero and/or one, limitations of the beta distribution and beta regression models become apparent. One recent approach is to use an inflated beta regression model which has discrete point-valued components. In this article, we introduce a new class of regression models fory is an element of [0,1] that is fully continuous. This allows the entirety ofyto be treated as a continuum instead of discontinuously, which appears to be a new development for the literature. We use a Bayesian approach for estimation. We also illustrate the impact of different choices of prior distributions on empirical findings and perform a simulation study examining model fit.

AB Purpose As organizations globalize, they are facing twin challenges of (1) how to develop actionable intelligence from the vast amount of data flowing into their organization and (2) how to effectively manage the increasing risks to their supply chain. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to bring these two issues on a single platform to understand how firms can effectively predict supply chain risk by developing and using BDA capabilities, through an automated risk alert tool. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a questionnaire-based survey methodology supported by secondary data to collect information related to managerial perceptions on how firms can develop a risk alert tool by improving BDA capabilities. A database of 213 senior and middle-level managers was developed and used to test the proposed hypothesis. Using econometric techniques, the authors identify the conditions necessary for such an automated risk management tool to be effective. Findings The results suggest that if organizations focus on developing an effective IT infrastructure supported by a strong BDA capability, they will be able to leverage these capabilities to develop an effective risk management tool. Moderating influences of Upstream and Downstream Supply Chain IT Infrastructure capabilities were also observed on different types of BDA capabilities within a firm. In conclusion, it was argued that the effectiveness of a risk alert tool is dependent on how well firms harness big data analytics capability. Originality/value The value of the research stems from the fact that it uses managerial surveys to identify specific BDA capabilities that can enable firms to develop risk resilience capabilities. In addition, the article is one of the few empirical studies that aims to identify how firms can use BDA capabilities within a supply chain context to develop an automated risk alert tool. The article, therefore, contributes to the literature that identifies the value of BDA capabilities within the context of supply chain risk management.

AB With increasing global exposure, organisations have started to witness supply chain risks that they traditionally were not exposed to. This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm's supply chain, impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance. The article concludes with our findings, along with managerial and practitioner implications of the research.

AB IntroductionPrevious research has found that political discourse over proposed legislation that impacts lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ +) people serves as a distal stressor which is associated with poorer mental and physical health. This study sought to document responses to the 2020 US Presidential election among LGBTQ + people living in the USA.MethodsNineteen LGBTQ + people ages 20 to 76 (M = 47.20; SD = 17.66) living across the USA were interviewed via Zoom video conferencing software between October and early December 2020. The modal participant was female (36.8%), identified as gay or lesbian (47.3%), and White (84.2%). Interviews were coded using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith & Osborn, 2003).ResultsSeventeen codes emerged, which were grouped into three themes. Participants viewed specific political figures, namely then-President Trump and Supreme Court nominee Coney-Barrett, as symbolic of the potential loss of rights and disenfranchisement of LGBTQ + people. Participants exhibited uncertainty about the future; however, a Biden presidential win was viewed as potentially instilling complacency and leading to fracturing of the LGBTQ + community. While some participants avoided news, most were engaged with the political process as a means of coping with election uncertainty.ConclusionsThe findings have implications for better understanding the concerns of LGBTQ + folks as it relates to how they view political discourse and the future of the equality movement.Policy ImplicationsPolicies which beneficially impact and engage a diverse range of LGBTQ + people would facilitate mobilization of LGBTQ + political communities.

TI The Provider's Body in the Therapeutic Relationship: How Complementary

SO HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; NARRATIVES; ILLNESS
AB Although the body is central to health outcomes, the provider's body has been largely absent in the provider-patient relationship. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers (N = 17), this study examines how CAM providers use their body to characterize their work as healers. The findings suggest the provider's self-reflexive awareness of their own body's illness and faith experiences informs their understanding of the patients' experience of health and disease. The study foregrounds the intersubjective nature of the provider-patient relationship as an embodied interaction in the mutual construction of therapeutic goals. Provider reflection on their own bodies to make sense of their patients' experiences emphasizes provider-patient coproduction of meaning and suggests ways for including the provider's self-reflexive awareness of their own body in a patient-centered healthcare relationship in ways that benefit both the patient and the provider.

AB Despite LGBTQ + serving organizations being bastions of education, support, and advocacy for LGBTQ + communities, there is a dearth of work on LGBTQ + people's experiences with them. Through qualitative interviews with U.S. LGBTQ + residents (N = 19), we explore what LGBTQ + people experienced from LGBTQ + serving organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the challenges, barriers, and support that LGBTQ + people encountered, the meaning they received from LGBTQ + serving organizations, and the tensions between caring for self and others. We provide recommendations for how LGBTQ + serving organizations can better meet the needs of diverse LGBTQ + people.

AB Background:
   Patient descriptions of pain shape the pain experience, yet there is insufficient understanding of how patient communication can help providers lessen pain's psychological and physical impact.
   Objective:
   To examine how individuals communicate their pain experience in the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider-patient relationship.
   Method:
   Qualitative thematic framing examining semistructured interviews of a purposive and snowball sample of CAM patients (N = 13; 850 double-spaced pages) recruited from the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
   Results:
   Complementary and alternative medicine patients communicate the pain experience through an awareness of their interdependence with: (a) relational spaces as attention to the self, the healing practices, and the provider; (b) physical spaces as openness to surroundings and the spatiality and temporality of self; and (c) physiological spaces as breathing and neurological and immune system functioning.
   Conclusion:
   A therapeutic relationship cultivating interdependence through awareness of relational, physical, and physiological spaces supports patients' ability to open up to, know, and accept their body. The CAM provider's work connects their practice with patient awareness of control over their environment, relationships, and physiology to redefine their pain experience.

TI Flyby Measurement of the Magnetic Field of a Helmholtz Coil with a Smart
   Cart
SO PHYSICS TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCELERATION
AB The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific's smart cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for the smart cart by carrying out flyby measurements of the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil. Recently, Monteiro et al. reported a similar experiment with a single coil but with an ordinary laboratory cart, and had to use the accelerometer of a smart-phone to laboriously extract the precise position of the mag-netic field sensor of the smartphone. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using the accelerometer and the concomitant laborious extraction of the position data. The eponymous smart cart broadcasts its precise location wirelessly over Bluetooth (R). In addition to the single circular coil verification of the Biot-Savart law, we also used the Helmholtz coil to generate and measure a uniform magnetic field over a wide central region.

AB The Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education (JSDSE) has a history of initiatives to expand its readership and impact. In this article, we reflect on JSDSE's relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE's K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author's article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.

A theoretical model is developed and the corresponding hypothesis is tested through a survey instrument and quantitative analysis. The results show that if firms adopt BDA capabilities then it positively moderates the impact of RMI on risk resilience, improving the effectiveness of a risk management infrastructure.

AB This study investigates the impact of mobile money (MM) on SMEs' resilience and the associated business outcome in developing countries amid Covid-19. Despite the potential of MM to improve SMEs' resilience, little evidence has been documented. Using Enterprise Survey data in Zambia, we show that SMEs are more likely than large firms to experience catastrophic sales decline, reflecting their inherent vulnerability. Further analysis reveals that this unfavourable effect can be effectively counteracted when SMEs incorporate MM into daily business. An important policy implication is that the use of digital technologies should be a key element of policy responses to Covid-19.

AB PurposeThis study examines the relationship between investors' familiarity bias, including the home bias and endowment bias, and their financial situations, expectations and personal characteristics.Design/methodology/approachUsing the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the authors utilize an ordinary least squares regression to identify the presence of endowment bias and home bias in individual investors' direct stock holdings and use a Heckman selection model to examine determinants of the extent of endowment bias and home bias.FindingsThis study finds that investors with higher income and more education, men, non-white investors and people with greater risk tolerance are actually at a greater risk of endowment bias. This study also identifies a profile of investors that are more likely to have a home bias: with less financial sophistication, lower net worth, older, female, more risk-averse, with a positive expectation about the domestic economy and a relatively shorter investment horizon.Originality/valueThis paper is among the first to use US investors' directly reported stock holdings to examine the individual characteristics that are correlated with greater familiarity bias, providing financial professionals with information about how to allocate their limited time in providing education to a variety of clients.

AB Store-in-store agreements occur when retailers lease their retail space to other retailers or brand manufacturers. Although this phenomenon is popular in practice academic research has not offered insight into how it impacts retailers. In addition, extant studies are mute on what retailer-specific characteristics determine the outcome of pursuing this strategy. Results from an event study of 185 announcements of store-in-store agreements show that they increase firm value by an average of 1.06% highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. Further analysis reveals that several characteristics of store-in-store agreements augment firm value. Specifically, positive firm value accrues when retailers enter store-in-store agreements with retail partners that are dissimilar and have a congruent brand image. The results also show that for retailers leasing retail space store-in-store agreements with reputable retailers increases their firm value. Whereas, for retailers renting retail space partnering with a retailer that has a large retail presence augments their firm value.

The first part of this experiment utilizes high-throughput experimentation techniques to reinforce, explore, and extend fundamental concepts that are represented in the classroom, including the use of air-free Schlenk techniques and heteronuclear NMR analysis. The second component challenges students to evaluate their results to design, set up, and perform a preparative-scale Buchwald-Hartwig amination. Finally, students purify and isolate their products using column chromatography allowing them to fully characterize their target molecules through a variety of analytical techniques. This experiment represents one of the final experiments performed in the fourth-year undergraduate chemistry curriculum and serves as a capstone learning experience for students.

AB In 2016, Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) was listed as federally threatened in the United States, due largely to declines from white-nose syndrome (WNS). The dramatic decline of this species heightens the significance of new occurrences outside the known range. Herein we report the first ever capture and genetic confirmation of an adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, MD, located on the northern portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This finding suggests further surveys are needed along the Atlantic Coastal Plain to determine if this region is being increasingly utilized by this species in the era of WNS.

AB Social work, with its commitment to social justice, knowledge about cultural diversity, and respect for the dignity and worth of the individual, has much to contribute to the modern-day human rights debate. Many international social work scholars have articulated the view of social work as a human rights profession. The profession's presence in this arena, however, has not always been apparent. Amid increasing global tensions and domestic challenges, equipping social work students with human rights knowledge and skills is critical. The limited attention given to human rights in social work education, particularly in the United States, provides a unique opportunity to explore the human rights discourse occurring in academic circles. This paper presents a review of scholarly journal articles that explore the human rights discourse related to social work education in the United States. Upon reviewing the literature, the following categories emerged: (1) general articles on integrating human rights into social work education; (2) pedagogical frameworks, models, and examples of incorporating human rights into social work education; and (3) measures and perceptions related to assessing the integration of human rights in social work education. Findings indicate that the inclusion of human rights into social work education in the United States is in its infancy. It is recommended that social work programs in the United States be more intentional about integrating human rights content into the curricula to train culturally competent and globally minded social workers.

AB Background: Ayurveda's preventive focus complements its strength with the interventionist approach of the biomedical in chronic pain self-management. Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To examine how Ayurveda's philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management. Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions: The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement. Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that relates the individual and the ecological in the patient's own life-context and supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical framework.

AB The initial development of Silicon Valley and its indigenous start-ups relied on various endowments, including abundant resources and a set of institutions and know-how inherited from previous industrial activity. This article identifies the entrepreneurial ecosystem that supported key tech start-ups on the San Francisco Peninsula prior to the 1960s, shows how the ecosystem developed and how it evolved. By 1940, a far-flung ecosystem-from Santa Clara County to San Francisco to Washington, DC - was in place, well before the arrival of the Valley's first venture capitalists in 1959 and the establishment of the region's first high-tech law firm in 1961. Federal agencies and laws provided revenue and risk reduction. Local universities provided brainpower. San Francisco-based banks and their Peninsula branches provided financing. San Francisco law firms drafted organizational agreements and protected intellectual property. Without such institutional support, there would be no Silicon Valley as we know it. Silicon Valley's early high-tech start-ups were supported by an ecosystem that was developed for the agriculture, extractive, and transportation industries. That ecosystem was repurposed for defence-based electronics and telecommunications, and then transformed for the consumer world of calculators, video games and personal computers. The "master cluster" benefitted from being in the right place at the right time, and by inheriting the right ecosystem.

AB Forensic pathologists are commonly tasked with identifying human remains. Although DNA analysis remains the gold standard in identification, time and cost make it particularly prohibitive. Radiological examination, more specifically analog imaging, is more cost-effective and has been widely used in the medical examiner setting as a means of identification. In the United States, CT imaging is a fairly new imaging modality in the forensic setting, but in more recent years, offices are acquiring CT scans or collaborating with local hospitals to utilize the technology. To broaden the spectrum of potential identifying characteristics, we collected 20 cases with antemortem and postmortem CT images. The results were qualitatively assessed by a forensic pathologist and a nonmedically trained intern, and all cases were correctly identified. This study demonstrates that identification of human remains using visual comparison could be performed with ease by a forensic pathologist with limited CT experience.

AB Multiple historic sources were used to reconstruct the forests of the Chesapeake at the time of European colonization. Early written records (1588-1699) show forests composed of hardwoods and conifers; the most commonly reported hardwoods are oak (100% occurrence in the texts), followed by walnut (93.3%), sassafras (86.7%), mulberry (80.0%), ash (60.0%), and chestnut (60.0%), and the most commonly reported conifers cedar (92.9%), pine (86.7%), and cypress (73.3%). It is likely that these reports focused on trees of economic value. John Smith's 1612 map of the Chesapeake shows a forest composed of ca. 50:50 ratio of hardwoods to conifers. Hardwoods could not be identified further, while conifers could be grouped into what appear to be pine, cedar, and baldcypress. Advertisements of land for sale or lease (1751-1838) show a forest primarily composed of hardwoods (86.5%), predominantly oak, with a small conifer component (13.5%). Forest cover averaged 61.5% and ranged from 19.7 to 100%. There is no relationship between percentage of forest cover and date of advertisement, indicating little change over that time frame on settled land. Advertisements of wood for sale or wanted also indicate a forest dominated by oak. Oak was the primary material for ship construction and barrel making, as well as the major fuel source. Witness tree records from the seventeenth century (the earliest reported) on Maryland's Eastern Shore show that a mature Oak-Pine forest dominated the pre-settlement forest, with white oak (Quercus alba) the most common hardwood. Currently a Pine-Oak-Maple forest dominates the landscape, with pines the dominant conifer and maple, particularly red maple (Acer rubrum), the dominant hardwood, mainly due to fire suppression in the twentieth century.

AB Given the long-term human habitation and prolific land use change trajectories in the eastern United States, few remnants of the pre-European settlement Mid-Atlantic forest remain on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This study utilized metes and bounds witness tree locations and descriptions produced during colonial land subdivision to understand the relationships between tree types and biogeographic environments for an area on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Using correspondence analysis, we reveal habitat partitioning among witness tree species based on soil drainage characteristics, that enable the visualization of a pre-European settlement reconstructed forest. Our research finds that oak (Quercus), most often white oak (Quercus alba), was the dominant genus for most of the study area underlain by well-drained soils. To a much smaller extent, gums were also associated with these well-drained soils. Areas of poor drainage most often contained pine (Pinus) and an assemblage of different oaks (Quercus spp.). Hickory (Carya), also noted in the witness tree record in small numbers, was found across all soil drainages.

AB Although considerable research has targeted fall prevention among older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), less is known about their ability to rise from the floor. The aim of the current exploratory study was to examine the relationship between floor rise and physical performance tests. A cross-sectional design was used. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age = 74.8 years, SD = 9.5 years) performed a standardized floor rise test and physical performance assess-ments in a structured task circuit. Mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 sec-onds (SD = 7.6 seconds). Fourteen (70%) participants used a quadruped strategy to rise to stand. Supine-to-stand performance time was significantly correlated with all physical performance measures. Findings serve as a catalyst for nursing and rehabilitation professionals to examine floor rise ability, prevent adverse effects of a critical fall, and instruct fall recovery techniques in clinical settings.

AB Objective: Stress remains a major health concern among college students today. Consequently, research on student stress is imperative, from both an organizational and an individual perspective. This research study explores the moderating role of coping skills on the relationship between self-leadership and stress among college students. Participants: Data from 643 full-time undergraduate students attending a 4-year public university in the mid-Atlantic region were collected in February 2017 and analyzed using a moderated regression model. Results: The results indicate self-leadership practices do reduce student stress levels and that this relationship is moderated by student coping skills. Conclusion: The findings from this study deepen our understanding of how self-leadership practices may decrease student stress and showcases self-leadership as an effective tool for reducing college student stress.

AB Cattle treated with chemicals to control parasites can fecally excrete residues that have the potential to adversely affect local assemblages of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Using 200-m transacts and dung-baited pitfall traps. we compared the dung beetle communities on 19 cattle farms in Maryland, USA where pests and!or parasites were controlled with chemicals (CU. n = 9 farms) or where no chemicals were used (NCU, n = 10 farms). Traps were baited once a month with fresh cattle dung from each location. We collected a total of 31 species comprising 12,380 dung beetle specimens. The five most abundant species, Onthophagus taunts (Schreber), Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold, Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), Blackhurneus stercomsus (Melsheimer), and Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar). accounted for 85% of the total individuals sampled. No difference was found when comparing total abundances of dung beetles sampled from NCU and CU farms. There was, however, a consistent significant effect of month across multiple dominant species. Using Random Forests analyses, we determined site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as additional important predictor variables affecting dung beetle abundances on Maryland farms. Present-day management practices implement a broad spectrum of chemical usage. Our work examines this variability to facilitate the understanding of factors currently affecting the biodiversity and abundance of beneficial dung beetles.

AB Intersectionality was developed by legal scholar Kimberle Williams Crenshaw in the late 1980s to broaden legal and epistemological frameworks for peoples at the intersection of multiple oppressions, such as racism and sexism. The theory has since proliferated and grown across many international academic and public contexts. This article examines intersectionality in Crenshaw's original formulation to argue for theoretical and political insights when intersectionality is applied to the multiply minoritized position of Sikhs in the US and India. I argue for six theoretical formations that can illuminate what I term intersectional Sikhism: intragroup solidarity, intergroup alliances, postsecularism, untranslatability, precarity, and intellectual intersectionality.

AB Background:Palliative care is a precursor for hospice care, an underutilized Medicare benefit that has been shown to improve quality of life, decrease health care costs, and provide expert symptom relief at the end of life. Local Problem:Palliative patients transitioning to hospice services were experiencing delays within the admission process. Purpose:To determine whether standardizing the workflow process with chart completion leads to increases in the hospice admission rate for palliative care patients transitioning to hospice care. Methods:This quality improvement project adapted Kurt Lewin's change theory and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle for implementation. Preintervention patient data were collected from May 2021 through August 2021, and postintervention data were collected from September 2021 through December 2021. Interventions:Standardization of the workflow process included assigning an urgency level to the hospice referral and deactivation (close) of the electronic medical record (EMR) chart, signaling completion of the workflow process. Results:The palliative care to hospice admission rate increased by 11.5% in the postintervention group. The EMR chart deactivation rate increased by 55.3%, which was statistically significant (P <= .001). Conclusions:The standardized workflow process increased the number of palliative care to hospice admissions and improved the effectiveness of transitioning palliative care patients to hospice services.

AB Teaching with cases, especially at universities where cases are not a regular part of the curriculum, poses challenges for both faculty and students. The results in this research present an effective and manageable method to introduce the case analysis process and to facilitate written case analysis for both students and faculty. Experiment 1 compares the effectiveness of a semistructured one-page written case analysis over a traditional case analysis and finds the shorter assignment results in shorter grading time and better student grades. A two-case method introducing the case analysis process is tested in Experiment 2 and finds that a short lecture introducing the case analysis method and an initial small group practice case further improves student grades. Theoretical reasoning and directions for future research are discussed.

ID LANGUAGE; SPACE
AB Utilizing evidence from literary stylistics, and in keeping with the Kachruvian tradition, this paper makes the case for WE scholars to remain vigilant of the move away from the revolutionary heteroglossia and de-Englishing strategies hallmarking literary creation and analyses of postcolonial writings from the margin - so apparent in Braj B. Kachru's works - to a current era of monoglossic inspired re-Englishing strategies underpinning the post-globalist enterprise of so-called 'flat-world' fiction in which under the guise of linguistic deterritorialization, center and periphery stratificational and spatialized arrangements emerge somewhat mitigated - even obfuscated. In the current post-structuralist-turn where contextual-oriented rather than form-focused analyses and the 'spatial turn' prevail, it is contested, Kachruvian-spotlighted linguistic asymmetries still matter. Evidence is provided from emerging frameworks in the sociolinguistics of mobility, pedagogical linguistics, and political economy to demonstrate the intellectual staying power, and relevancy of Kachruvian frameworks for current sociolinguists.

Anxiety symptoms for these students can be challenging to identify because they mimic diagnostic characteristics. As key intervention team members, school-based mental health professionals can assist with identifying and addressing anxiety in students with autism. Specific evidence-based strategies for school-based mental health professionals are detailed to support efforts to intervene successfully with students with autism who experience anxiety.

AB Madonna's book Sex (1992) is the world's largest-grossing illustrated book, selling 1.4 million copies worldwide and earning US$70 million in sales at retail. This essay is the first to use methods from the discipline of bibliography to analyze the book's production, distribution, and reception. This article extends scholarship on Madonna, including about her iconicity and visuality, from her songs and videos to her print culture. I demonstrate how Sex - both as a printed book and as an expression of national culture - is part of a dynamic American book history that constructs notions of America, including freedom of speech, thought, and religion.

AB The growing human population is responsible for a massive decline in species, biodiversity, and ecosystems across the globe. If we are to significantly slow these losses, the attention and resources devoted to individual causes should be commensurate with the magnitude of their contribution to the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitude of five major threats to species identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction. Specifically, we analyzed the entire IUCN Red List database to determine the percentage of threatened species affected by overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species, diseases, and genes. We also randomly sampled a portion of the database to estimate the percentage of species for which each threat was the dominant threat placing them at risk of extinction. Of the 20,784 species for which data were available, 88.3% were impacted by habitat destruction, 26.6% by overexploitation, 25% by invasives, 18.2% by pollution, and 16.8% by climate change and weather. Focusing on dominant threats, the percentage of species for which a given threat was the main factor pushing them toward extinction was as follows: habitat destruction 71.3%, overexploitation 7.4%, invasives 6.8%, pollution 4.7%, climate change, and weather 1.8%. Regardless of how percentages are calculated, habitat destruction threatens more species than all other categories combined, climate change the fewest. From the perspective of species and biodiversity conservation, these data suggest that a significant change in global environmental priorities is needed. Habitat destruction should become a greater focus of global environmental efforts and receive the attention and resources appropriate to the extraordinary magnitude of its impact. Moreover, while it is important to address all environmental problems, given the disproportionate impact habitat destruction has on species, care should be taken to avoid solutions to other problems that exacerbate this destruction.

AB Stigler (Bell J Econ Manag Sci 2:3-21, 1971) proposed that regulation benefits politically influential interest groups rather than advancing the public interest. The Stiglarian perspective predicts that regulation raises barriers to entry that limit competition and creates economic rents for incumbents. Apart from the direct economic harm of such policies, regulation generates additional consequences. One hypothesized consequence ushered by anticompetitive rules is the widening of income disparities. This article therefore surveys the growing empirical literature that studies whether regulation ultimately exacerbates income inequality. Beginning with the literature on entry and start-up regulation, we find that these rules, as predicted by Stigler, limit entry and dampen entrepreneurship. Moreover, recent studies also indicate that these regulations are associated with higher income inequality. We also review the literature on occupational licensure. Consistent with Stigler (Bell J Econ Manag Sci 2:3-21, 1971), the literature chronicles widespread use of barriers to entry in labor markets, which have documented regressive effects on the distribution of income. Finally, we review research on financial regulation, in which studies have shown that some financial regulations are associated with less entrepreneurship and higher income inequality. Taken together, the recent empirical literature buttresses and extends the implications in Stigler (Bell J Econ Manag Sci 2:3-21, 1971). Regulation tends to benefit incumbents by limiting entry of economic participants, be it firms or workers, and exacerbates income inequality.

AB In this article, I argue for a chronotopic-scalar system of images and resolutions in the analysis of language use in general and multilingual practices in particular. Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants' chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the 'realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.

AB The work of teaching includes many in-the-moment decisions for teachers to make. In this study, we focused on the decisions prospective teachers made within the elementary context specific to shared teaching practice in mathematics and science instruction - elicit and use evidence of student thinking. Within a qualitative multisite case study, we analyzed data for how PTs took up student thinking within instructional decisions, and the nature of responsive moves enacted within an animated context once student thinking had been elicited. Findings reveal PTs were responsive to elicited student thinking. Most commonly, PTs' instructional decisions involved asking additional questions or inviting students to test their ideas. However, PTs' pedagogical moves varied across mathematics and science disciplines. Our findings guide teacher educators to focus on what moves best support PTs' development to use evidence of student thinking across disciplines in the elementary classroom. The consistency of asking questions within mathematics and science begins to inform the quest for shared core practices. Results highlight the benefit of using technology (i.e. animations) as a tool to support PTs' learning of instructional decisions and pedagogical moves to uncover the nuances of the teaching practice elicit and use evidence of student thinking.

AB This study examined the role of perceived organizational commitment on managers' assessments of employees' career growth opportunities. Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees' affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.

AB This paper compares the US long-run macroeconomic effects of foreign direct investment from Japan (1970-1990) with foreign portfolio investment from China (2000-2018). Investment from the both countries lowers the US inflation rate, and the effect from Japan is stronger than that from China. While Japan's investment in the 1970-1990 period accounts for 88% of the unemployment-reducing effect of the overall US financial account surplus, China's investment in the 2000-2018 period explains 65% of the unemployment-deterioration effect as well as 96% of the inflation-reducing effect of the overall US financial account surplus. The US inflation and unemployment impulse responses exhibit the pertinent supportive evidence. Furthermore, in contrast to Japan's direct investment, China's portfolio investment is more sensitive to dollar depreciation, higher inflation rate and lower real interest rate in the USA.

AB Kindergarten through second-grade elementary schools that best serve students with dyslexia have principals who are knowledgeable about dyslexia and understand the best practices for providing intervention for students with dyslexia. In this study, three styles of leadership were examined to understand the implication that leadership has on intervention for dyslexia: transformational, instructional, and integrated leadership. However, many students in elementary schools have difficulty learning to read despite good leadership by the principal, with 5-20% of students being diagnosed with dyslexia. While these students need phonetic, multisensory intervention to build necessary reading skills, this study found that many principals lack knowledge of this specialized instruction. The purpose of this research was to explore variables that determine the school-based level of appropriate intervention for students with dyslexia. A questionnaire assessing leadership skills, knowledge, and beliefs about dyslexia, preparation in reading disorders and/or dyslexia received from degree programs and professional development, and services provided to students with dyslexia was given to K-2 principals serving in schools across the United States. Results indicated that regardless of leadership style, principals who have greater knowledge and more correct beliefs about dyslexia provide more appropriate school-based services for students with dyslexia. Eight detailed K-2 principal/practitioner recommendations are included based upon this key finding.

AB This article analyses Aravind Adiga's Booker prize-winning novelThe White Tiger(2008) through the lens of justice: philosophical, legal, and literary. What is justice when its agent is subaltern - disprivileged by both caste and class - and delivers justice to himself? I argue that the fictional representation of class, caste, poverty, and violence can be similar to the structuring and translations of justice. By writing his novel from the perspective of a subaltern character, Adiga joins the call by Dalit critics to reconfigure modernity from the interests of the oppressed and the marginalized. In the process, there can be a rethinking of postcolonial literary criticism from within the postcolonial nation, rather than the established perspective of the postcolonial nation understanding its own colonial oppression. My essay provokes wider insights into the implications for justice and human rights as they are informed and represented by literary fiction, subaltern theory, and deconstructive theory. How can a writer conceive of and represent justice - literary justice - by working within and against philosophical and legal conceptions of justice? The philosophers and theorists I invoke include Drucilla Cornell, Jacques Derrida, Wai Chee Dimock, Emmanuel Levinas, Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak, and Robert Young.

AB This interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) inquiry examined critical racialized incidents students of Color experienced in the graduate classroom at a predominantly White academic institution. Five African American. 4 Latinx, 4 Asian American, and 1 Biracial student participated in the study. Nine participants identified as women, and 5 as men. A total of 20 critical racialized incidents were reported and 6 dominant themes identified: (a) intersectionality and manifestation of power differentials; (b) personal devaluation, invalidation and/or shaming; (c) projection of racial stereotypes onto students of Color; (d) uncontested racist comments; (e) differences in communication styles and preferences; and (f) institutional devaluing of racial diversity. In contrast to previous research (Boysen, 2012; Sue, Lin, Torino, Capodilupo, & Rivera, 2009), an unexpected finding was that instructors, not students, were the most frequent perpetrators of racism in the classroom. Types of racism and magnitude of incidents were also considered. Implications for social justice education were discussed, with specific recommendations for instructors and academic institutions identified.

AB Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the daily lives of millions of people around the world, substantially increasing anxiety and stress levels for many. Psychological capital (PsyCap), a multidimensional construct that includes hope, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy, may serve as a resource for helping people more effectively cope with uncertainty resulting in lower levels of perceived stress. The authors hypothesize a negative relationship between PsyCap and perceived stress that is partially and differentially mediated by adaptive and maladaptive coping styles. The authors further hypothesize that work context (home vs workplace) will moderate the relationships between coping styles and perceived stress. Design/methodology/approach After receiving Institutional Review Board approval, data were collected during the first week of May 2020 using an online survey. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, specifically Mplus 8. The authors validated their initial findings using PROCESS Model 14 with 5,000 boot-strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Findings The authors' results show that adaptive and maladaptive coping styles differentially mediate the effects of PsyCap on perceived stress with the indirect effects of PsyCap on perceived stress through maladaptive coping being stronger than the indirect effects through adaptive coping. The authors found support for the relationships in our hypothesized model. Practical implications The authors' findings suggest that health interventions aimed at increasing PsyCap may be an effective means of reducing maladaptive coping and perceived stress. Future research should continue to explore PsyCap as a potential means of shaping positive health behaviors. Originality/value This study makes a unique contribution to the literature by explaining how PsyCap operates through coping to affect perceptions of stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB "Lesson study" has garnered considerable attention from educational researchers and practitioners as a promising method for improving instruction. At its core, lesson study reflects a collaborative inquiry process, grounded in cycles of planning, enacting, and reflecting, that promotes teacher learning through active engagement in lesson refinement. In this article, we leverage lesson study as an exemplar case to foreground an examination and application of theory-based evaluation. We overview a novel evaluation framework contextualized to this multidimensional instructional program and draw out the contributions of theory-based evaluation to the study of program effects. To ground the description of this framework, we summarize representative findings from our ongoing evaluation of a lesson study-based instructional program and discuss processes for selecting, using, and managing evidence sources as well as determining causal strands supporting program outcomes. We conclude by discussing lessons learned and implications for theory-based evaluation of complex programs.

AB Habitats with spatial variation in food availability, predation risk, and hunting pressure allow us to study how animals resolve the trade-off between food searching and predator avoidance. We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow-breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.

AB We compared microbial enzymatic activity and community composition in small, undisturbed, family cemetery soils and surrounding agricultural fields or suburban lawns to determine the effect of land use changes on soil biology. We collected soil from seven sites in Wicomico County, Maryland monthly for one year. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and dehydrogenase activity were significantly greater in the cemetery soils compared to field soils (agricultural and lawn) 63% and 30% of the time, respectively. Much less frequently the field soils had significantly higher microbial activity compared to the cemetery soils (10% of sample pairs for both FDA and dehydrogenase). FDA activity measurements were highest in the spring and lowest in late summer at all seven sites, while no seasonal variation was evident for dehydrogenase activity. Dominant bacterial phyla in the soils were similar between field and cemetery sites with the exception of Gemmatimonadetes having higher relative abundance in fields. Fourteen genera differed in relative abundance between cemeteries and fields, and the relative abundance of these genera correlated with soil pH, organic matter, and phosphorus levels. There was no difference in phylotype richness or diversity between fields and cemetery soils. Based on FDA hydrolysis, microbial activity is greater in cemetery soils, providing evidence to suggest land use changes have altered the biological properties of these soils.

AB There is often conflict between disclosures and actions in corporate operations. One area of interest relates to the joint influence of tax avoidance and Corporate Social Responsibility on economic outcomes. We evaluate investor perceptions when these corporate behaviors are in conflict, and our results indicate that tax avoidance negatively influences investment decisions. We find that although CSR in isolation has no direct effect, the negative influence of tax avoidance is tempered when it is present. We provide evidence that not only do a firm's policies related to CSR and tax avoidance result in diverse investment intentions, but also that it is the individual's unique beliefs on ethics and CSR that appear to be driving these differences. Our results suggest that espousing stakeholder values serves as a shield to protect the company from the negative consequences associated with tax avoidance, and that individual attitudes can shape perceptions relative to these behaviors.

AB Despite the benefits of using smart speakers, serious privacy concerns have been raised, particularly due to their constantly listening microphones. Given the mixture of the advantages and risks deciding whether to use them is not an easy matter, casting a doubt about sustainable growth and development of smart speakers. Using a sample of 559 users in South Korea and the U.S., we empirically investigated the dilemma of users seeking to adopt smart speakers. The results revealed users' perceived usefulness and enjoyment positively influenced the intention to adopt smart speakers. No direct effect of perceived ease of use was found but this effect was completely mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment was found to be twice as strong as perceived usefulness in determining the usage intention, confirming the hedonic aspect of smart speakers. Conversely, perceived privacy risks were shown to be a significant negative factor. This negative impact was significantly stronger in the U.S. than in South Korea. We could infer that the more mature the stage of acceptance of smart speakers, the greater the sensitivity of users to privacy risks. Lastly, in the South Korean sample, we found that the perceived usefulness could reduce the negative impact of perceived risks on the intention. to adopt smart speakers.

AB BackgroundPrevious work from our lab has described a model of motor nerve degeneration in hyperglycemic zebrafish larvae which resembles mammalian models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Here, we optimized the hyperglycemic-induction protocol, characterized deficits in nerve structure and behavioral function, and then examined the regenerative potential following recovery from the hyperglycemic state. ResultsIn agreement with our previous work, hyperglycemia induced motor nerve degeneration and behavioral deficits. However, the optimized protocol initiated disruption of tight junctions within the blood-nerve barrier, a phenotype apparent in mammalian models of DPN. Following a 10-day recovery period, regeneration of motor nerve components was apparent, but behavioral deficits persisted. We next examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system and found subtle deficits in muscle that resolved following recovery, and robust deficits in the skeletal system which persisted following recovery. ConclusionHere we optimized our previous model of hyperglycemia-induced motor nerve degeneration to more closely align with that observed in mammalian models and then characterized the regenerative potential following recovery from hyperglycemia. Notably, we observed striking impairments to skeletal development, which underscores the global impact hyperglycemia has across systems, and provides a framework for elucidating molecular mechanisms responsible for regenerative events moving forward.

AB Diabetes mellitus-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a number of pathologies such as retinopathy, nephropathy, delayed wound healing, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop DPN, which is characterized by disrupted sensory and/or motor functioning, with treatment limited to pain management. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an emerging animal model used to study a number of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and delayed wound healing have all been demonstrated in zebrafish. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that following the ablation of the insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas (and subsequent hyperglycemia), the peripheral nerves begin to show signs of dysregulation. In this study, we take a different approach, taking advantage of the transdermal absorption abilities of zebrafish larvae to extend the period of hyperglycemia. Following 5 days of 60 mM D-glucose treatment, we observed motor axon defasciculation, disturbances in perineurial glia sheath formation, decreased myelination of motor axons, and sensory neuron mislocalization. This study extends our understanding of the structural changes of the peripheral nerve following induction of hyperglycemia and does so in an animal model capable of potential DPN drug discovery in the future.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Zebrafish are emerging as a robust model system for the study of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and impaired wound healing. We present a novel model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in zebrafish in which the integrity of the peripheral nerve is dysregulated following the induction of hyperglycemia. By using this model, future studies can focus on elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms currently unknown.

Understanding what influences transition from clinician to educator and retention can improve approaches used in nursing programs for those aspiring to careers in nursing education. Purpose This qualitative study elicited the experiences of participants who completed a structured program to prepare clinicians to become clinical faculty for prelicensure students. Methods Focus groups uncovered participant perspectives on "learning how to teach." Results Using interpretive phenomenological analysis, the themes (1) I'm not sure I can do this, (2) changing perspectives-learning to teach, and (3) instilling confidence emerged. Conclusions Novice educators reported benefitting most from exposure to multiple teaching methods, simulated teaching encounters, and group debriefing as they learned to become educators.

AB Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is estimated to affect 50% of diabetic patients. Although DPN is highly prevalent, molecular mechanisms remain unknown and treatment is limited to pain relief and glycemic control. We provide a novel model of acute DPN in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. Beginning 5 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish expressing nitroreductase in their pancreatic beta-cells were treated with metronidazole (MTZ) for 48 h and checked for beta-cell ablation 7 dpf. In experimental design, this was meant to serve as proof of concept that beta-cell ablation and hyperglycemia are possible at this time point, but we were surprised to find changes in both sensory and motor nerve components. Compared with controls, neurod(+) sensory neurons were often observed outside the dorsal root ganglia in MTZ-treated fish. Fewer motor nerves were properly ensheathed by nkx2.2a(+) perineurial cells, and tight junctions were disrupted along the motor nerve in MTZ-treated fish compared with controls. Not surprisingly, the motor axons of the MTZ-treated group were defasciculated compared with the control group, myelination was attenuated, and there was a subtle difference in Schwann cell number between the MTZ-treated and control group. All structural changes occurred in the absence of behavioral changes in the larvae at this time point, suggesting that peripheral nerves are influenced by acute hyperglycemia before becoming symptomatic. Moving forward, this novel animal model of DPN will allow us to access the molecular mechanisms associated with the acute changes in the hyperglycemic peripheral nervous system, which may help direct therapeutic approaches.

AB In emerging markets, private label growth has not kept pace with the growth in private labels elsewhere. In Europe and North America, private labels now constitute an average of 35% of total retail market share, but market shares vary between 1% and 8 % in emerging markets. Existing explanations for this observation do not account for the unique nature of manufacturer-retail relationships in emerging economies. That is, in most emerging economies, national brand manufacturers tend to be the sole producers of private labels. We investi-gate whether national brand manufacturers possess bargaining power relative to retail buyers and, if so, we examine how this may affect private label market shares. The results show that dominant manufacturers set relatively high wholesale prices for private labels, which in turn leads to higher-priced private label products, and low private label market shares.

AB Repellants can be very useful in managing red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, particularly in some scenarios where application of synthetic insecticides is not appropriate. Our previous study showed that fire ants cannot transport food on surfaces treated with eugenol, and the repelling effect lasted for > 24 h, which motivated us to extend our research on eugenol derivatives. Herein, the electrophysiological effect, toxicity and repellency of five eugenol derivatives (methyl isoeugenol, eugenol acetate, isoeugenol, methyl eugenol, and isoeugenyl acetate) were evaluated against S. invicta workers. All eugenol derivatives triggered significantly higher EAG responses than the hexane blanks and had concentration-dependent toxicity against S. invicta workers. All tested eugenol derivatives except isoeugenyl acetate showed strong repellency by significantly decreasing the number of defending (aggression mode) and foraging (non-aggression mode) ants in the tested arenas. Unexpectedly, methyl isoeugenol almost repelled all defending fire ants from disturbed mounds. This compound also repelled foraging ants significantly longer than eugenol. At the concentration of 50 mg/kg in sand, methyl isoeugenol was the only tested compound that completely suppressed the digging behavior of S. invicta workers. In addition, fire ants exhibited low levels of nesting behaviors in flowerpots containing sand treated with each eugenol derivative (500 mg/kg). Surprisingly, the repellency of methyl isoeugenol in flowerpots containing treated sand could last for almost one month. Our study may bring an opportunity to develop strong and long-lasting fire ant repellant products against foraging, defending, and nesting fire ants.

AB Agricultural growth and urban development have increased nutrient loading into streams to unnatural levels, negatively affecting estuaries downstream. Wetland creation along streams has the potential to mitigate watershed nutrient loading, providing the necessary conditions to encourage bacterial denitrification. We compared denitrification in two wetland systems, one recently created and one well established, along a branch of the St. Martin River, the largest and most degraded tributary flowing into the Maryland Coastal Bays. Ambient and potential denitrification rates were measured using membrane inlet mass spectrometry, and the denitrifying bacterial communities were compared using qPCR with genes nirK, nirS, nosZ-I, and nosZ-II. For all sites, denitrification rates were highly variable, but similar between the two wetlands, while potential rates increased almost 10-fold after a NO3- amendment, indicating that the denitrifying communities can respond to pulses of NO3- delivered via episodic flow events. Overall, the denitrifying community was more abundant at the created wetland, but the reference site had a higher abundance of the nosZ-I gene and, therefore, a lower genetic potential for N2O production. The created wetland has developed denitrification rates and a denitrifying community similar to those of the established wetland and could successfully remove excess nutrients entering the system.

DT Article
DE Regulation; Poverty; States; FRASE; Regressive effects; RegData

AB We estimate the impact of federal regulations on poverty rates in the 50 US states using the recently created Federal Regulation and State Enterprise (FRASE) index, which is an industry-weighted measure of the burden of federal regulations at the state level. Controlling for many other factors known to influence poverty rates, we find a robust, positive and statistically significant relationship between the FRASE index and poverty rates across states. Specifically, we find that a 10% increase in the effective federal regulatory burden on a state is associated with an approximate 2.5% increase in the poverty rate. This paper fills an important gap in both the poverty and the regulation literatures because it is the first one to estimate the relationship between the two variables. Moreover, our results have practical implications for federal policymakers and regulators because the greater poverty that results from additional regulations should be considered when weighing the costs and benefits of additional regulations.

AB Many animals acoustically communicate in large aggregations, producing biotic soundscapes. In turn, these natural soundscapes can influence the efficacy of animal communication, yet little is known about how variation in soundscape interferes with animals that communicate acoustically. We quantified this variation by analyzing natural soundscapes with the mid-frequency cover index and by measuring the frequency ranges and call rates of the most common acoustically communicating species. We then tested female mate choice in the tungara frog (Physalaernus pustulasus) in varying types of background chorus noise. We broadcast two natural tungara frog calls as a stimulus and altered the densities (duty cycles) of natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics to form the different types of chorus noise. During both conspecific and heterospecific chorus noise treatments, females demonstrated similar preferences for advertisement calls at low and mid noise densities but failed to express a preference in the presence of high noise density. Our data also suggest that nights with high densities of chorus noise from conspecifics and heterospecifics are common in some breeding ponds, and on nights with high noise density, the soundscape plays an important role diminishing the accuracy of female decision-making.

AB As the roles of faculty members have continued to expand, leaders in higher education need a better understanding of the drivers of faculty engagement. The current paper develops and tests a hypothesized model of faculty engagement in which faculty member grit is positively related to faculty member engagement both directly and indirectly through faculty member-academic chair leader member exchange (LMX). Using a sample of 156 faculty members in a mid-sized public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, we tested the hypothesized model using PROCESS Model 4 with 5000 boot-strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Results show significant direct positive relationships between faculty member grit and faculty member engagement and between faculty member-academic chair LMX and faculty member engagement, but no significant indirect relationship of faculty member grit through LMX. Implications for higher education leaders are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research.

AB Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg is an economically important tree species that produce the highly prized agarwood. In recent years, agarwood production has been seriously threatened by the outbreak of Heortia vitessoides Moore, a leaf-eating pest that shows gregariousness during the larval stage. However, little attention has been paid to the aggregation behavior of H. vitessoides larvae. In the present study, we collected 102 cohorts of H. vitessoides larvae (13,173 individuals in total) in the wild; 54 cohorts were comprised of the same-instar larvae, and 48 cohorts were comprised of larvae with different developmental stages (instars). In general, young larvae (<third instar) tended to form large aggregations, whereas older-instar larvae were either solitary or formed small aggregations. Laboratory studies showed a strong aggregation tendency in the newly hatched and second-instar larvae of H. vitessoides, whenever the individuals originated from the same or different sibling cohorts. In addition, all newly hatched larvae died within two days after they were isolated. When newly hatched larvae were initially assigned in 10-larvae cohorts (containing sibling individuals) or 20-larvae cohorts (either containing individuals originating from the same or different sibling cohorts), their larval survivorship, duration of larval stage, and adult emergence were not significantly different. Interestingly, combining avermectin-treated larvae (donors) with untreated ones (receptors) significantly decreased larval survivorship and adult emergence of receptors, indicating a horizontal transfer of avermectin among H. vitessoides larvae. This study enhances our understanding of the population ecology of H. vitessoides, and may bring novel insights into the management strategies against this pest.

AB Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is defined as "being reduced to group stereotypes within an individual's healthcare encounter," leading to experiences of stigma and discrimination. This current study explores how older gay men living with HIV attribute their healthcare experiences to their social identities. Using HCST as a guiding framework, a content and structural coding analysis was conducted on transcripts from 11 interviews of older gay men living with HIV. The majority of HCST experiences were connected to the social identities of sexual orientation, HIV status, and age. Many of the healthcare experiences that participants discussed were related to interactions with healthcare providers and the attitudes of healthcare providers. This study illustrates how participants attributed social identities to healthcare experiences that showed qualities of HCST. These outcomes highlight how marginalized social identities impacted the lifetime healthcare experiences of this group of older gay men living with HIV.

AB PurposeThis paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the impact of a corporate label change (CLC) from investors' perspective, especially based on the stakeholder approach to corporate identity. The resource-based theory has been used as a theoretical root of understanding the antecedents and consequences of brands. The authors specifically examine how two important types of firm-level heterogeneity - firm size and firm age - change shareholder reactions. In addition, the authors also test the moderating effects of firm performance.Design/methodology/approachUsing Korean company data, the authors first calculate the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) with the two-day event window [-1,0]. Then, the authors test the impacts of firm size and age on CAR with ordinary least squares regressions. To understand greater dynamics, the authors also test the moderation effects of firm performance. For the robustness check, the authors test using a different event window and different measures as well.FindingsThe findings for South Korean companies reveal that CLC itself does not significantly affect shareholder value. However, firm size and firm age show positive and significant coefficients. This means that larger and older firms are more likely to have better investor reactions. In addition, the authors also test a moderation effect of firm performance. The result shows that the impact of firm size weakens when firms have better performance.Research limitations/implicationsThe first limitation is the generalizability of the findings, particularly those regarding the impacts of CLC on investor reactions. A second limitation is that the authors did not consider the time gaps between CLCs. Third, there are limitations of using an event study with stock market data due to the ambiguity of the causal relationship between a firm's strategic choices and market reactions. Lastly, the authors use all CLCs except CLCs related to corporate governance (i.e. mergers and acquisitions).Practical implicationsAlthough managers expect positive relations by introducing new corporate label, the outcomes may not be sufficient because potential losses (i.e. losing royal customers) are significant. Hence, more careful considerations are required when a manager forms a new CLC. The results provide valuable insights for the conditions when large and aged companies pursue CLCs. In addition, the needs of a CLC are increasing when a company shows underperformance. Poor performance is a trigger for introducing new strategic choices (Boeker, 1997). The finding can be another supporting material for managers to consider when they intend to perform CLCs.Originality/valueThe authors probe the effect of CLC on external stakeholders, particularly investor reactions. The current literature has discussed the impacts of CLC on employees, internal stakeholders, and customers, external stakeholders. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no strategy for understanding a CLC under stakeholder aspects. The authors believe that the findings contribute to the extant literature on CLC. This question is also important to a manager. Although introducing a new corporate label is a popular strategy for firms to provide corporate identity to various stakeholders, many cases have shown mixed results. This research provides evidence of what to consider when a manager makes its decision.

AB Advancing technology and increasing demand for contactless purchase methods have encouraged retailers to integrate technology into the point-of sale experience. However, limited research explores how consumers perceive contactless payment technology compared with traditional payment methods. Two experiments demonstrate that contactless payment methods, when compared with traditional, contact forms of payments such as cash and credit card transactions, are perceived as less contaminated. Additionally, consumers using contactless payment technology hold more favorable attitudes toward the retailer. However, the benefits derived from using contactless payments are negated for retailers whose customers expect to use contaminated methods of payment, such as cash.

AB The Council on Social Work Education understands the growing influence of technology on social work practice and education, including the need for students to develop the knowledge and skills to use modern technologies, including Twitter, both professionally and ethically. With the inclusion of technology in social work education, the efficacy of these methods must be assessed. This study aims to conduct the initial phase of scale development, an exploratory factor analysis. Using a purposive sample of over 200 BSW and MSW students in one university, this study presents results of the exploratory phase of the Technology Effectiveness and Social Connectedness Scale, which can be used to assess the effectiveness of incorporating Twitter into social work courses.

AB Tracking the introduction of non-native reptiles is important for understanding the effects of non-native species and is potentially a process aided by citizen science. We present new observations of the mourning gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, (Dumeril and Bibron, 1836) on a new island in the Caribbean. Lepidodactylus lugubris was observed on Paradise Island, The Bahamas concomitant with citizen science observations on iNaturalist. An additional iNaturalist observation is presented, documenting a second report of L. lugubris on Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. These reports demonstrate significant spreading of this non-native parthenogenetic species from its first record on a Caribbean island 10 years ago, the utility of citizen science observations for documenting the spread of non-native reptiles, as well as an observation of this species utilizing non-anthropogenic habitats in the Western Hemisphere, a potential precursor to detrimental effects on native species.

ID ECONOMIC-FREEDOM; GROWTH; PANEL; ENTRY; LIBERALIZATION; CAPITALISM;

AB Income inequality in the United States has risen over the past several decades. Over the same period, federal regulatory restrictions have increased. An emerging literature shows that regu-lations can have regressive effects on the distribution of income, exacerbating inequality. The Federal Regulation and State Enterprise (FRASE) index quantifies the regulatory restrictions that apply to each US state by industrial composition. We construct a panel of 50 US states from 1997 to 2015 to test whether states exposed to more federal regulatory restrictions have higher levels of income inequality. The results indicate that a 10 percent increase in federal regulation is asso-ciated with an approximate 0.5 percent increase in income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. When states are rank-ordered by average Gini coefficient, a 0.5 percent increase in income inequality will typically result in a two-position decline in state ranking.

DE International business; Environmental uncertainty; Governance modes;
   International franchising; Property rights theory; Firm resources and
   capabilities; Franchisor choice model; Market entry; re-entry
AB Purpose
   This study aims to provide an empirical test of an existing theoretical model depicting the governance modes used by international franchisors when entering international markets.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Using a unique panel data set of 222 market expansions by US firms over a seven-year period, this paper tests hypotheses regarding the factors affecting the franchisors' choice of governance modes when entering foreign markets.
   Findings
   Franchisors use governance modes with lower levels of control when faced with environmental uncertainties due to corruption, economic downturns and when the geographic distance is large. Moreover, the franchise system assets and its local market assets also affect the choice of governance modes.
   Practical implications
   Firms need to balance the costs of environmental uncertainty with the need to safeguard the firm's capabilities and resources using governance modes with appropriate levels of control. This balance changes as the franchise company gains more experience in the local market and as once-emerging markets continue to develop.
   Originality/value
   This research identified additional governance modes used by franchisors compared to previous studies. Using multiple theoretical perspectives, the study supported significant portions of the Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger (2014) model of franchisor governance mode choice.

AB This paper investigates how market-oriented reforms affect firm incentives to innovate. We utilise the market reforms enacted in Korea following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 as an empirical setting to show why an institution-based view is crucial to understanding the factors that incentivize firms to innovate. Additionally, we draw on the competitive strategy literature to investigate how market reforms - combined with industry competition and firm-specific factors - affect innovation-related investments. Our findings suggest that market reforms positively influence both innovation input and output, but these associations are contingent on firm-specific factors.

AB Mobile journalism is one of the fastest areas of growth in the modern journalism industry. Yet mobile journalists find themselves in a place of tension, between print, broadcast, and digital journalism and between traditional journalism and lifestyle journalism. Using the lens of field theory, the present study conducted an online survey of mobile journalists (N = 39) from six countries representing four continents on how they conceive of their journalistic role, and how their work is perceived within the newsroom. Participants were journalists in television, print, magazine, and digital local and national newsrooms. The present study sought to understand how mobile journalists see mobile production as a part of their journalistic role, and what field theory dimensions influence mobile production in their newsrooms. While prior research has established a growing prevalence of lifestyle journalism, the present study finds that the growth of mobile journalism represents the development of lifestyle journalism norms, such as content driven by the audience, within even traditional journalism.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of oral hygiene promoting program (OHPP) using a smartphone endomicroscope among students in elementary schools in Bangkok, Thailand, to enable their oral hygiene maintenance and to compare oral health outcomes in the intervention program between the experimental and control groups. Design/methodology/approach This is a quasi-experimental research study consisting of two groups, a pretest, a posttest and a follow-up design. The student sample consisted of 59 fifth graders who matched the study criteria on medium and low levels of teeth brushing skills. There were 29 experimental group participants who completed the six-week OHPP using a smartphone endomicroscope. Another 30 participants formed the control group involved in the ordinary oral health education program. The comparison data for oral health behaviors (knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP)) and oral hygiene were statistically analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Findings Results indicated that the experimental group exhibited higher oral health behaviors regarding KAPs and oral hygiene related to teeth cleanliness and gum health than the control group in the postexperimental and follow-up phases. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to tongue cleanliness. Originality/value The students maintain their own oral hygiene due to a provision of activities related to KAP concerns. The instrument helped the students to find tooth decay and dental plaque associated with teeth cleanliness after brushing their teeth.

AB Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating genetic neuromuscular disease. Diffuse neuropathology has been reported in SMA patients and mouse models, however, functional changes in brain regions have not been studied. In the SMND7 mouse model, we identified three types of differences in neuronal function in the cerebellum and motor cortex from two age groups: P7-9 (P7) and P11-14 (P11). Microelectrode array studies revealed significantly lower spontaneous firing and network activity in the cerebellum of SMA mice in both age groups, but it was more profound in the P11 group. In the motor cortex, however, neural activity was not different in either age group. Whole-cell patch-clamp was used to study the function of output neurons in both brain regions. In cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of SMA mice, the input resistance was larger at P7, while capacitance was smaller at P11. In the motor cortex, no difference was observed in the passive membrane properties of layer V pyramidal neurons (PN5s). The action potential threshold of both types of output neurons was depolarized in the P11 group. We also observed lower spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity in PN5s and PCs respectively from P11 SMA mice. Overall, these differences suggest functional alterations in the neural network in these motor regions that change during development. Our results also suggest that neuronal dysfunction in these brain regions may contribute to the pathology of SMA. Comprehensive treatment strategies may consider motor regions outside of the spinal cord for better outcomes. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

AB Hearken is a proprietary news engagement platform growing in popularity. Under the Hearken approach, audience members are invited to participate in the newsmaking process. Hearken strives to assist news organizations in providing local and hyperlocal content that meets audience needs and demands while preserving elements of the journalist's role as gatekeeper. Hearken has also worked to help news organizations reach underrepresented populations with mixed results per its own anecdotal analyses. This study employs a quantitative content analysis comparing one year's worth of coverage at four different local NPR affiliates in the United States to provide a breakdown of Hearken content versus traditional reporter-driven content in the following four categories: emphasis on hyperlocal coverage, story topic prevalence within local and hyperlocal coverage, emphasis on coverage of underrepresented communities, and story topic prevalence within coverage of underrepresented communities. Findings reveal listener-driven Hearken content favors hyperlocal news on lifestyle issues while reporter-driven stories emphasize state-level governance and politics as well as local crime. These indicate a stark contrast between the content audiences want and that which journalists tend to report. The nuanced normative implications, possibilities and limitations of Hearken's model of "deep participation" are addressed in some detail.

AB The New York Department of Sanitation's recycling program is under threat by an "an organized, sophisticated mob of scavenger collectives." How is this "mob" threatening the NYC Department of Sanitation? They are removing scrap metals before the city can collect it. We use this event as an entry into exploring the practice of recycling in relation to administrative constructs through the lens of deliberative policy analysis (DPA). We discuss how the identity of "the recycler" derives from administrative conduct and concern. In the interest of fulfilling the goals of "recycling," administration influences the collective understanding of who is a recycler and how the related practice of recycling is understood in the management of waste. We use the case to distinguish between the idea of social construction and that of administrative construction by highlighting the production of an identity (the recycler) through administrative practices that define an activity (recycling). Doing so highlights the conflicting concerns in key pillars of DPA, particularly how the interpretive power of administration to define and determine practice can restrict deliberative potential.

AB Accurately remembering how and when one's own learning occurs is an important metacognitive skill that matures during the early school years. In two studies, the impact of a delay on this ability was examined. In Study 1, 30 children in two age groups (4-year-olds and 5-year-olds) participated in two-staged learning events and were interviewed immediately after each event about the facts they had learned in the events and about how they had acquired them. Children in both age groups learned the facts, but had significant difficulty reporting on their own learning. In Study 2, 79 children in the same age range participated in one staged learning event and were given similar interviews as in Study 1, either immediately after the event or after a 2- to 3-day delay. Five-year-olds were more accurate in their memories of learning in the delay condition than in the immediate condition, but 4-year-olds showed no performance differences as a function of delay. Findings are interpreted in light of developmental literature on episodic memory, source monitoring, and memory binding.

AB We empirically investigate the theory that regulatory growth within an industry disproportionately burdens small businesses relative to their larger competitors. Using RegData 3.0, we find that a 10% increase in industry-specific regulatory restrictions is associated with a 0.5% reduction in the number of firms regardless of firm size, but a 0.6% reduction in employment only among small firms. We also find that consecutive years of high regulatory growth amplify the associated negative effects of future regulations on the number and employment of small firms, but we find no amplifying effects for large firms. Finally, we find that higher regulatory growth rates are associated with lower job destruction rates among establishments owned by large firms. These findings are consistent with the Public Choice theory of regulation and imply that regulatory growth leads to fewer small businesses and reduced small business employment, with minimal negative impacts on large businesses.

AB The goal of this paper is to investigate how deregulating foreign equity ownership influences a firm's innovation investment. We attempt to answer this question using data from 530 Korean manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2003 through generalised estimating equations. Our findings suggest that foreign ownership and R&D investment exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship because the incentives to monitor managers' decision-making processes initially play a greater role, but this role stagnates as the share owned by foreign investors becomes concentrated. In addition, we consider firm heterogeneity and observe the negative moderation effects of firm age and the positive moderation effects of growth opportunity.

AB Adoption of third-party channels for last mile delivery has been a significant change for retail firms. Despite the volume of work in this space, how last-mile delivery partnerships impact a retail firm's financial valuation has received little attention. Adopting a resource-based view, we explore how third-party delivery firms add value through their unique capabilities. Results from an event study reveal that, on average, third-party delivery partnerships improve firm performance. However, subsequent analysis reveals that firms do not equally benefit from these partnerships. In particular, the density of firms' presence in the marketplace and retailers' level of service provision can affect the relative benefit of third-party partnerships.

ID HEALTH-HEALTH ANALYSIS; PANEL; POLICY; INCOME; COSTS; CARE
AB Previous research speculates that some regulations are counterproductive in the sense that they increase (rather than decrease) mortality risk. However, few empirical studies have measured the extent to which this phenomenon holds across the regulatory system as a whole. Using a novel U.S. state panel data set spanning the period 2000-2014, we estimate the effect of U.S. federal regulation on state-level mortality. We find that a 1% increase in federal regulation of state economies is associated with an increase in an index of state mortality of between 0.53% and 1.35%. These findings are robust to the form of mortality measure, choice of covariates, and the inclusion/exclusion of various regions, states, and industries. We also provide an update of the "cost-per-life saved cutoff," which is the counterproductive risk threshold for expenditures. We find that expenditures in excess of $38.6 million (2019 dollars) per life saved can be expected to increase mortality risk. This article fills an important gap in the empirical literature and boosts the credibility of mortality risk analysis, whereby public policymakers weigh both the expected lives saved and lost due to a proposed regulation or other policy.

AB This paper studies the strategic relationship between investment in financial literacy and seeking advice from a financial planner. While the existing literature on this topic considers financial literacy as exogenously given, we propose a simple model in which it is endogenously determined through the consumer's investment in financial literacy. Our theoretical model suggests that in this case, investment in financial literacy and financial advice-seeking are substitutes. We test this hypothesis using data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. When using the propensity score matching method to control for selfselection bias, we find a significant negative relationship between the probability of seeking advice from a financial planner and investment in financial literacy. While these findings cannot be easily explained by existing models, this paper shows that endogenizing financial literacy reconciles the results.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential counteracting influence of individual resilience levels on the tendency of role stressors, stress arousal and burnout to reduce job satisfaction and increase turnover intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study surveys 332 auditors from the offices of nine public accounting firms. The structural equations modeling procedures examine an expanded role stress model to assess the nature and extent of the role that resilience plays in reducing stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and turnover intentions.
   Findings
   Resilience has a significant direct negative association with stress arousal and burnout, a significant indirect positive association with job satisfaction and a significant indirect negative association with turnover intentions.
   Research limitations/implications
   As a cross-sectional study that incorporates self-report instruments, no definitive statements can be made about causality. However, the results extend the extant knowledge related of the role of resilience as a coping mechanism within the role stress paradigm in auditor work settings.
   Practical implications
   This study's findings suggest the potential value of resilience training programs at public accounting firms to reduce staff burnout. In turn, reduced burnout has an increased likelihood ceteris paribus of increasing job satisfaction and reducing auditor turnover intentions.
   Originality/value
   This study's findings suggest that resilience training for public accounting staff to reduce burnout may provide the organizational and personal benefits associated with enhancing job satisfaction and decreasing turnover intentions.

AB PurposeThis study aims to examine the relationship between objective and subjective aspects of financial well-being, the role of family financial support and depression symptoms of Chinese older adults.Design/methodology/approachThis study used two waves (2015 and 2018) of the Harmonized China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Two financial ratios: the expenditure-to-income ratio and the financial assets ratio, were used to measure the objective aspect of financial well-being. Perceived money management difficulty was employed to measure the subjective aspect of financial well-being. Depression symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score. Three analytical models, including an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, an OLS model controlling for lagged depression and a random effects model using panel data, were used to examine the relationships between the objective and subject aspects of financial well-being and depression.FindingsThe results from the three models showed consistent relationships: the expenditure-to-income ratio was a positive contributor, while the financial assets ratio was a negative contributor to depression of older adults in China. The robustness check using binary-coded financial ratio thresholds showed that reaching the suggested thresholds was negatively associated with depression. Perceived money management difficulty contributed positively to depression. The robustness check using the fixed effects model showed no significance of the two ratios, while perceived money management difficulty was positively associated with depression. The insignificance might be due to data limitation (limited waves or rare changes across waves).Originality/valueThe findings indicate that both objective and subjective financial well-being matters in relation to depression symptoms and, therefore, to the overall mental health of the Chinese elderly. Developments in public policies are needed to promote accessible financial services, assistance programs, mental health services and facilities for the older population in China.

AB Sexual minority people in the United States are less likely to have access to health services when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Less is known about the within-group sociodemographic memberships among sexual minority people regarding access to health services. Using data from a nationally representative sample, a series of univariate and bivariate analyses were used to determine associations between sociodemographic group membership and access to health services. Results suggest there are significant differences in access to health services within the sexual minority population. Differences in access to health services when considering sex-at-birth, sexual identity, age, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, education level and income status were found. These findings offer insight into the role sociodemographic group membership has on the equity of access to health services. Specifically, results indicated that disproportionate access to health services among sexual minority people were more pronounced among those with group membership who experience social marginalisation. This was particularly true for sexual minority people who were bisexual, younger, Black and Latinx, lower-income earners and sexual minority people with less education attainment. Results from this study may be used to inform policies and practices aimed at improving access to health services including, but not limited to, the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and continued development of Federally Qualified Health Centers, while acknowledging the role of within-group differences among sexual minority people.

AB Parents are core decision-makers and advocates for their pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children, yet there is a dearth of research on their experiences, particularly their relationships with extended family members. This study explored how parents make decisions of whether or not to disclose their children's TGNC identity to extended family members. In Phase 1, 34 parents of TGNC youth under the age of 13 described in interviews their experiences pertaining to disclosure of their child's TGNC status to extended family members. Phase 2 replicated and expanded these findings with 11 additional parents. Across both phases, two disclosure processes were identified:casual unfolding disclosure, where parents allowed extended family members to witness their child's TGNC identity development, orexplicit direct disclosure, in which parents wrote mailed or emailed letters to help organize their thoughts and direct the course of the conversation. Parents avoided disclosure to select family members, based on five factors: geographical or emotional distance, age, and how conservative or religious family members were. While some relationships were strengthened with disclosure, many parents described tense or unsupportive relationships with extended family members, and some relationships dissolved. The findings suggest extended family members are both potential supporters and stressors, and parents engage in a variety of strategies to bolster their supportive networks while anticipating rejection and mitigating stress. These findings have implications for social work research, practice, and policy.

AB This paper explores the processes through which visceral experience is cultivated, packaged and commodified in the Linguistic Landscape (LL) of South Delhi, India. We engage the theoretical concept of cultural chronotopes (Agha, 2007a) to demonstrate how spatially and temporally entwined experiences of nostalgia and modernity are produced in South Delhi's commercial LL, and show how such positioning serves to compress or flatten such experiences for ready consumption (Kockelman, 2006). Focusing on particularized chronotopes tied to a privileged and elite experience, imagination and aspiration, we highlight how discourses of the ` ideal' are reproduced and positioned as visceral through specific references or semiotic arrangements. In so doing, we discuss the quantification of experience executed by these signs in commodifying the visceral, and the problematic way these instances propagate an idealized, sanitized and simplified understanding of Indian rural communities, Indian history and Indian traditional practices.

AB Corporations, which in the past have been hesitant to contribute to conversations regarding political and social issues, are increasingly speaking out on current issues such as race, sexual orientation, gender, immigration, and environmental issues. Despite this trend, limited academic research has focused on how corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) efforts impact firm value. In addition, extant studies have not fully identified the extent to which the firm and their message influence the outcomes of this approach. The current study explores how sociopolitical stances communicated on Twitter affect firms' stock prices. Results from an event study of 260 incidents of CSA show that CSA efforts decrease firm value by an average of 0.22%, indicating that wading into social or political issues is a risky strategy. However, further analysis highlights the importance of clearly articulating stances on social issues that align with the firm's core values.

AB This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance-low acquisition, (II) low alliance-high acquisition, (III) high alliance-low acquisition, (IV) high alliance-high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance-very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.

AB We explored how a group of 105 diverse middle-school students self-assessed their work as readers and writers during a summer enrichment program. Findings from the study revealed hauntings related to youth perceptions of language and literacy, evidence of a ghostly presence of standard language ideology. In the self-assessments, youth discussed speed and volume, in addition to surface features of language, more frequently than meaning-related aspects of literacy. These findings indicate the persistence of traditional definitions of literacy and thus the need for teaching that disrupts narrow understandings about the nature of reading, writing, and language.

AB This research investigates the software vendor-based relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk. The data is obtained from the China National Vulnerability Database of Information Security (CNNVD). At first, we use the latent class model to classify the software vendors into three categories, and then employ regression models to estimate relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk for each of the three categories of the software vendors. The results show the relationships vary across the software vendors. The findings suggest that an IT vendor should learn specific vulnerability features according to its type to effectively avoid vulnerability generation on their products.

AB The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.

AB Evidence suggests that cash transfers through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) programme induce better birth outcomes. We use US Vital Statistics data for all births in Maryland from 1995-2004 to capture the casual effects of implementing a local EITC programme across households. Alternative difference-in-differences (DD) comparison groups compare treatment households with like households in non-EITC counties and ineligible households in the same county. We find that the implementation of the local EITC reduced the probability of low birth weight by as much as 3.5 percentage points for births to White and Black mothers with little evidence of an effect for Hispanic mothers. This reduction represents a 46% decrease for White mothers and 26% decrease for Black mothers. Despite improving average birth outcomes, EITC cash transfers did not reduce disparities in birth outcomes.

This study explored the early parenting experiences of 34 parents of pre-adolescent TGNC youth. Parents were recruited from online communities and listservs, and interviewed via phone about their early parenting experiences. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis. Findings indicate that parents became aware of their child's TGNC identity either through observing their child's gender behaviors, or by their child verbalizing their identity. Parents, on average, became aware of their child's gender identity exploration when they were just over 3 and a half years old. Parents felt a mix of emotions, with many reporting a lack of concern or positive emotions regarding their child's rejection of traditional gender roles. Parents without prior knowledge of transgender people or existing connections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) people sought out information from the Internet. The findings are both consistent with and diverge from prior research with parents, suggesting both new areas for research, and additional ways in which TGNC youth and their parents can be best supported.

AB There is a need for more research on the experiences of affirming parents of pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children. This study explores how parents conceptualized advocacy roles. Eleven parents of TGNC children age 13 and under completed semi-structured phone interviews. Ten parents considered themselves advocates, with digital advocacy being the most common. Advocacy motivations centered around parental concerns. Parents were divided on whether advocacy helped or had no impact on the parent-child relationship. The largest-shared concern was over the right to privacy. These findings have implications for mobilizing parents of TGNC youth as advocates.

AB Many species that are birthed in one location and become reproductive in another location can be treated as if in a one-dimensional habitat where dispersal is biased downstream. One example of such is planktonic larvae that disperse in coastal oceans, rivers, and streams. In these habitats, the dynamics of the dispersal are dominated by the movement of offspring in one direction and the distance between parents and offspring in the other direction does not matter. We study an idealized species with non-overlapping generations in a finite linear habitat that has no larval input from outside of the habitat and is therefore isolated from other populations. The most non-realistic assumption that we make is that there are non-overlapping generations, and this is an assumption to be considered in future work. We find that a biased dispersal in the habitat reduces the average time to the most recent common ancestor and causes the average location of the most recent common ancestor to move from the center of the habitat to the upstream edge of the habitat. Due to the decrease in the time to the most recent common ancestor and the shift of the average location to the upstream edge, the effective population size (Ne) no longer depends on the census size and is dependent on the dispersal statistics. We determine the average time and location of the most recent common ancestor as a function of the larval dispersal statistics. The location of the most recent common ancestor becomes independent of the length of the habitat and is only dependent on the location of the upstream edge and the larval dispersal statistics.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Habitat loss, degradation, and modification are important drivers of global population declines in amphibians. Most amphibians have a biphasic lifestyle and are susceptible to threats in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) are endangered throughout much of their range in the eastern United States, including Maryland and Delaware. Ambystoma t. tigrinum breed in ephemeral freshwater ponds and then migrate into the surrounding terrestrial environment after metamorphosis. Limited research exists about what habitat characteristics play a role in breeding pond use. We sought to understand what features of the breeding pond and surrounding landscape influence abundance and occupancy. We measured salamander occupancy, salamander abundance, and water quality parameters at ponds during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. We used geographic information systems to determine pond area and the percentage of forest area and road density surrounding a pond at four spatial scales. Pond occupancy by A. t. tigrinum was positively associated with increased depth and less forest cover at the largest spatial scales. Abundance of A. t. tigrinum was greatest in larger, deeper ponds, potentially because these factors increase hydroperiod. More basic pH and decreased conductivity were also associated with higher male salamander abundances in ponds. Forest area and road density were not in the top-ranked model, although we note that ponds in this study had a minimum of 70% forest area within 150 m. Our findings elucidate relationships between A. t. tigrinum and their habitat, providing knowledge for future management of this stateendangered species.

AB Hurricane Isabel (2003) generated record flooding around Chesapeake Bay and caused extensive damage in rural Eastern Shore of Maryland and metropolitan cities like Baltimore. Regional atmosphere-ocean models are used to investigate the storm surge and coastal inundation that might be produced by a similar storm under the warmer ocean temperature and higher sea level projected for the future climate. Warming causes the storm to intensify, with the minimum sea level pressure decreasing from 955 mb during Isabel to similar to 950 mb in 2050 and similar to 940 mb in 2100. The stronger storm and higher mean sea level amplify the peak water level by similar to 0.5 m in 2050 and similar to 1.2 m in 2100. The total inundated area over Chesapeake Bay expands by 26% in 2050 and 47-62% in 2100. Over the rural Dorchester County, the inundated area shows moderate expansion in the future climate but the average inundation depth is 30% higher in 2050 and 50-70% higher in 2100. The number of houses flooded increases from 1420 during Hurricane Isabel to 1850/2190 in 2100 under the climate change scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5/8.5. The inundated area in Baltimore is 2.2 km(2) during Hurricane Isabel, expands to 5.1 km(2) in 2050, and reaches 8.1/9.1 km(2) in 2100 under RCP 4.5/8.5. The estimated flood damage to Baltimore increases from $29 million in 2003 to $98/100 million in 2050 and $150/162 million in 2100 under the median projection of RCP 4.5/8.5. These estimates are subjected to uncertainty due to different climate change scenarios and different climate model projections.

AB Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the tropics, has a storied history that includes recent shifts in ecology due to a variety of point and nonpoint source anthropogenic impacts. Among the expanding industries contributing to environmental impacts (if not properly managed) is the recent and rapid expansion of cage aquaculture of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus). As part of an effort to assess the ecological consequences of this new industry, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), very high-resolution satellite imagery, and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to map the tilapia fish cages in the Kenya portion of Lake Victoria, Africa. Understanding the impacts of the growth of commercial finfish cage culture within Lake Victoria requires a systems view which, through the use of UAS and satellite technologies, can provide spatial context and change detection. This synthesis of UAS, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and GIS has allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of inshore tilapia fish cages with high positional accuracy. The significance of these observations lies in the speed and detection accuracy in the methodology, allowing for rapid visualization and assessment of cage culture in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria. As of 2012, there were very few floating aquaculture finfish cages in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria. Using UAS, satellite, and GIS technologies, in 2018 the same portion of the lake was found to contain 4357 fish cages covering 62,132 m(2).

AB PurposeLittle research has been done exploring the nature of multilingual students who are not categorized as English language learners (ELLs) in English language arts (ELA) classes. This study about a group of multilingual girls in an ELA class led by a monolingual white teacher aims to show how, when a teacher makes space for translanguaging practices in ELA, multilingual students disrupt norms of English only. Design/methodology/approachThe authors use reconstructive discourse analysis to understand translanguaging across a variety of linguistic productions for a group of four focal students. Data sources include fieldnotes from 29 classroom observations, writing samples and process documents and 8.5 h of recorded classroom discourse. FindingsStudents used multilingualism across a variety of discourse modes, frequently in spoken language and rarely in written work. Translanguaging was most present in small-group peer talk structures, where students did relationship building, generated ideas for writing and managed their writing agendas, including feelings about writing. In addition, Spanish served as "elevated vocabulary" in writing. Across discourse modes, translanguaging served to develop academic proficiency in writing. Originality/valueThe authors proposed a more expansive approach to data analysis in English-mostly cases - i.e. environments shaped by multilingual students in monolingual school contexts - to argue for anti-deficit approaches to literacy development for multilingual students. Analyzing classroom talk alongside literacy allows for a more nuanced understanding of translanguaging practices in academic writing. They also show how even monolingual teachers can disrupt monolingual hegemony in ELA classrooms with high populations of multilingual students.

ID JOB CREATION
AB Most researchers observe a negative association between regulatory accumulation and traditional measures of entrepreneurship (i.e., firm startups and job formation). However, when measuring business activity with metrics common to the dynamism literature, researchers fail to find a significant association between regulation and startup activity. After ruling out differences in unit of measure, industry aggregation, and regulation measurement, we demonstrate that differences in entrepreneurship and dynamism measurement are potentially responsible for the conflicting results. However, we do find empirical evidence that the relationship between regulations and job creation rates varies across industries. In industries with high job creation rates in the prior period, increased regulations are associated with lower job creation rates in the current period. However, the opposite is true in industries with low job creation rates in the prior period (i.e., increased regulations are associated with higher job creation rates in the current period). Depending upon the vintage of the regulation dataset (i.e., RegData 2.0), a similar pattern holds for the startup rate.

ID EMPIRICAL NOTE; QUALITY; LAW; EMERGENCE; COUNTRY; TRUST
AB Entry regulations, including fees, permits and licenses, can make it prohibitively difficult for low-income individuals to establish footholds in many industries, even at the entry-level. As such, these regulations increase income inequality by either preventing access to higher paying professions or imposing costs on individuals choosing to enter illegally and provide unlicensed services. To estimate this relationship empirically, we combine entry regulations data from the World Bank's Doing Business Index with various measures of income inequality, including Gini coefficients and income shares to form a panel of 115 countries. We find that countries with more stringent entry regulations tend to experience more income inequality. In countries with average inequality, increasing the number of procedures required to start a new business by one standard deviation is associated with a 7.2% increase in the share of income accruing to the top decile of earners, and a 12.9% increase in the overall Gini coefficient. This result is robust to the measure of inequality, startup regulations, and potential endogeneity. We conclude by offering several policy recommendations designed to minimize the adverse effects of entry regulations.

AB The presence of motion is increasingly common in online advertising. Despite the increase in spending on digital advertisements and decades of academic research on dynamic imagery in advertising, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. The dynamic default hypothesis posits that animated imagery should generate more arousal than comparable static imagery. However, research on advertisements containing dynamic imagery reveal inconsistencies in their ability to stimulate arousal. A potential explanation for these inconsistent findings lies in the behavioral urgency hypothesis, which postulates that not all motion is weighted equally in terms of its ability to generate arousal. We conduct three experiments to test this proposition. Interestingly, our findings show that imagery appearing to loom closer to consumers stimulates greater levels of arousal than either static or imagery appearing to recede away from consumers. Additionally, our work identifies moderating effects of lay rationalism which can work to strengthen or attenuate these effects. Together, this work provides a more comprehensive explanation for the varied findings in the literature.

AB Kostant's partition function counts the number of distinct ways to express a weight of a classical Lie algebra g as a sum of positive roots of g. We refer to each of these expressions as decompositions of a weight. Our main result considers an infinite family of weights, irrespective of Lie type, for which we establish a closed formula for the q-analog of Kostant's partition function and then prove that the (normalized) distribution of the number of positive roots in the decomposition of any of these weights converges to a Gaussian distribution as the rank of the Lie algebra goes to infinity. We also extend these results to the highest root of the classical Lie algebras and we end our analysis with some directions for future research.

AB This study's purpose is to examine whether resilience, conceptualized by Connor and Davidson (2003) as one's capacity to persevere and rebound under adversity, was a potential mitigating and/or moderating factor in the dynamic between both psychological distress and academic burnout, and student attrition. We concurrently distributed a survey containing a series of psychometric instruments to a convenience sample of 1,119 students pursuing various business majors at four geographically diverse U.S. universities. Via structural equations modeling analysis, we measured the associations between psychological distress, academic burnout, and departure intentions, and investigated whether student resilience levels are associated with lower distress, burnout, and departure intentions levels. The results indicated significant positive associations between psychological distress and each of the elements of academic burnout, and significant positive associations between the academic burnout elements and departure intentions. However, while resilience did not moderate those associations, it did attenuate them through its direct negative associations with both psychological distress and the cynicism and academic inefficacy elements of academic burnout. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for business educators seeking to enhance individual resilience levels as a coping strategy to combat voluntary student turnover, and better prepare students for the demands of the workplace.

AB How mundane or exotic the taste of a cuisine is considered, often determines what kind of visitors a restaurant is likely to get. However, restaurants find it difficult to both (i) gauge such customer expectations as well as (ii) target visitors with broad or narrow palates so as to successfully position their image and design offerings. The current research utilizes digital geolocation history data from restaurant check-ins along with Item Response Theory to identify mundane and exotic cuisines, and tastemakers with broader palates. Data is used from Chicago and San Francisco to compare definitions of exotic restaurant cuisines and tastemakers (visitors). In both cities, quick serve restaurants appear most mundane, while Lebanese and Turkish cuisine emerge as more exotic. Factors that explain palate diversity vary across the two cities.

AB Hedged mutual funds flourished following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. They became particularly popular with financial advisors because of their alleged downside protection. Did these funds deliver what they promised? We examine the performance of these funds with a focus on the post-2009 period. While they generated positive alphas before the crisis, we find that this abnormal performance vanishes in the post-2009 period as their strategies became increasingly crowded due to the above popularity. We show that flows to hedged mutual funds are negatively related to investor sentiment, implying that investors use these funds as a hedge against downside risk.

AB Let IG(k,2n + 1) be the odd symplectic Grassmannian. It is a quasi-homogeneous space with homogeneous-like behavior. A very limited description of curve neighborhoods of Schubert varieties in IG(k,2n + 1) was used by Mihalcea and the second named author to prove an (equivariant) quantum Chevalley rule. In this paper, we give a full description of the irreducible components of curve neighborhoods in terms of the Hecke product of (appropriate) Weyl group elements, k-strict partitions, and BC-partitions. The latter set of partitions respect the Bruhat order with inclusions. Our approach follows the philosophy of Buch and Mihalcea's curve neighborhood calculations of Schubert varieties in the homogeneous cases.

AB Retailers seek effective ways to communicate promotions to increase store traffic and drive purchases. We propose that right-slanted fonts which imply forward movement in their design may influence how consumers perceive and respond to advertised promotional events. Five controlled experiments demonstrate that promotions advertised with right-slanted fonts can increase consumers' retailer visit and purchase intentions. A field experiment demonstrates that right-slanted fonts can increase consumers' click through rate in email promotions. Right-slanted fonts are found to evoke dynamic mental imagery of the promotion moving forward in time and ending soon. Right-slanted fonts are shown to disproportionally influence the behavioral intentions of deal prone consumers who are more likely to experience anticipated inaction regret related to missing an advertised promotional offer. Relatedly, right-slanted fonts only appear to influence consumer behavioral intentions in the context of advertisements containing a promotional offer. (C) 2019 New York University.

AB In cities around the world, COVID-19 lockdowns have significantly improved outdoor air quality. Even if only temporary, these improvements could have longer-lasting effects by making chronic air pollution more salient and boosting political pressure for change. To that end, it is important to develop objective estimates of both the air quality improvements associated with lockdowns and the benefits they generate. We use panel data econometric models to estimate the effect of Bogot ' a's 16-month lockdown on PM2.5 and NO2 pollution, epidemiological models to simulate the effect of reductions in these pollutants on long-and short-term mortality, and benefit transfer methods to value the avoided mortality. We find that on average, Bogot ' a's lockdown cut PM2.5 pollution by 15% and NO2 pollution by 21%. However, the magnitude of these effects varied considerably over time and across the city's neighborhoods. Equivalent permanent reductions in these pollutants would reduce long-term premature deaths from air pollution by 23% each year, a benefit valued at $1 billion annually. Finally, we estimate that if they occurred ceteris paribus, the temporary reductions in pollutant concentrations in 2020-2021 due to Bogot ' a's lockdown would have cut short-term deaths from air pollution by 19%, a benefit valued at $244 million.

AB This chapter explores the domestication of Marx's critique of political economy within Marxist-oriented environmental sociology, and treadmill of production (ToP) theory, in particular. The aim is to explicate the theoretical resources for a rigorous critique of capital-induced planetary degradation. Shortcomings of ToP theory pertaining to the conceptualization of capital and value are identified. The reasons for these shortcomings, including how they might be addressed, are elaborated by reconsidering key aspects of Marx's critical theory of modern capitalist society. The chapter contributes to current discussions in both critical theory and environmental sociology by demonstrating the continued relevance of Marx's critical theory for understanding the political-economic, social, and ideational dimensions of planetary degradation. In contrast to ToP theory, which critically examines the production of wealth by counterposing finitude and limits against the expansionary tendencies of economic growth, the critical theory approach advanced in this chapter conceptualizes the acceleration of environmental degradation following World War II in terms of a ToP of value, whereby the necessity of the value form is continuously established in the present. The chapter discusses how Marxian critical theory facilitates a critical examination of the widespread growth of environmentalism as concomitant with the spread of neoliberal capitalism.

AB The positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and an employee's in-role performance is well-established, but explanations for why this effect exists are still in a nascent stage. Drawing upon leader behavioral integrity theory and job-demands resources theory, the authors explain how leader behavioral integrity facilitates employee in-role performance and the boundary conditions influencing the relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance. Using multisource data from 209 employee-manager dyads in South Korea, this paper found support for the mediating effect of coworker support in the positive relationship between leader behavior integrity and employees' in-role autonomy. Furthermore, compared to those who perceive low job autonomy, the positive indirect effect of leader behavioral integrity on in-role performance via coworker support was stronger for employees who perceive high job autonomy. The findings emphasize the importance of a leader's individual difference (i.e., leader behavioral integrity) and job resources (i.e., job autonomy) facilitating the receipt of team members' supporting behaviors which, in turn, energize employee in-role performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of internationalization on performance in family firms, as well as the potential impact of moderators on this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper is a meta-analysis of the impact of internationalization on performance in family firms, as well as the role of several moderators shaping this relationship, based on 29 studies.
   Findings
   The findings indicate a significant positive effect of internationalization on family firm performance. This relationship was stronger in family firms with lower family ownership. Several methodological moderators were significant, such as the means of measuring performance and internationalization. The results also point to several cultural moderators, such as individualism, masculinity, low uncertainty avoidance and short-term orientation, which positively influence the main effect.
   Originality/value
   The authors provide discussions of the results, their practical and theoretical implications, as well as avenues for future research.

AB The zygomatic root, along with other key craniofacial features, is hypothesized to play a crucial role in strengthening the face in response to stresses and strains related to feeding. As such, it has been cited as indicative of dietary specialization among fossil taxa, although it remains unknown how variable zygomatic arch root position is among living primates, and whether its positioning predicts differences in diet. We test whether primates that consume more mechanically challenging foods possess more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots compared to those consuming less challenging foods. Zygomatic root position, as defined by the zygomaxillare landmark, was identified and recorded from digital images and physical specimens of adult primate crania. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species (n = 722). Published data were used to assign species to a dietary type based on patterns of overall consumption along with reliance on especially challenging foods. Pairwise comparisons between mechanically challenging (hard and/or tough) and less mechanically challenging (soft) consumers found significant differences (p < 0.05) in the position of the zygomatic root in 17 of 20 pairs, 11 of which supported the prediction that a more mechanically challenging diet is associated with a more anteriorly placed zygomatic root. PGLS analysis found no significant effect of phylogeny on root position. This suggests that a more anteriorly positioned zygomatic root is useful for identifying dietary specialization in some taxa but is not required for consuming a mechanically challenging diet given that other craniofacial and behavioral factors can facilitate the consumption of such foods.

AB This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures. This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.

TI Chinese Americans' attitudes toward advance directives: An assessment of
   outcomes based on a nursing-led intervention
SO APPLIED NURSING RESEARCH

DT Article
ID CARE; COMPLETION; ADULTS; PERCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; PEOPLE; DEATH
AB Background: The process of advance care planning (ACP) encompasses learning about and planning for end-of-life (EOL) decisions, documenting preferences through legal forms known as Advance Directives (ADs), and having discussions with loved ones to share these preferences. While most ethnic minority groups have low ACP engagement and AD completion rates, Chinese Americans face additional challenges related to cultural beliefs and ACP.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of a culturally tailored nurse-driven educational intervention on the relationship between attitudes toward ADs and AD completion and ACP discussions.
   Design: Pre-posttest, repeated measures non-experimental design.
   Methods: A convenience sample of Chinese Americans participated in a culturally tailored nurse led AD and ACP workshop in English and Mandarin in a Chinese Community Center. Participants completed surveys before and after the workshop and at one-month follow-up.
   Results: Seventy-two Chinese Americans participated in this study. Most were female and born in China. Attitudes toward ADs improved after participating in the workshop and remained consistent at one-month follow-up. There was a significant positive relationship between attitudes and AD completion and ACP discussions.
   Conclusions: Nurse-driven interventions improved engagement in the ACP process in Chinese Americans, a population thought to be averse to discussing death and dying and one with lower than average AD completion rates. Using culturally tailored interventions improves engagement in the ACP process.

AB Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding (SSB) protein that is essential for all aspects of genome maintenance. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity but can also diffuse along ssDNA. By itself, RPA is capable of transiently disrupting short regions of duplex DNA by diffusing from a ssDNA that flanks the duplex DNA. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence and optical trapping combined with fluorescence approaches, we show that S. cerevisiae Pif1 can use its ATP-dependent 5 & PRIME; to 3 & PRIME; translocase activity to chemomechanically push a single human RPA (hRPA) heterotrimer directionally along ssDNA at rates comparable to those of Pif1 translocation alone. We further show that using its translocation activity, Pif1 can push hRPA from a ssDNA loading site into a duplex DNA causing stable disruption of at least 9 bp of duplex DNA. These results highlight the dynamic nature of hRPA enabling it to be readily reorganized even when bound tightly to ssDNA and demonstrate a mechanism by which directional DNA unwinding can be achieved through the combined action of a ssDNA translocase that pushes an SSB protein. These results highlight the two basic requirements for any processive DNA helicase: transient DNA base pair melting (supplied by hRPA) and ATP-dependent directional ssDNA translocation (supplied by Pif1) and that these functions can be unlinked by using two separate proteins.

AB Education could play a role in decreasing and mitigating damages caused by natural disaster. By analysing relationships between level of education and components of the World Risk Index, this study demonstrated an education's role in natural hazard awareness and mitigation. For this purpose, we analysed relationships between the components of WRI, created an education factor independent of WRI (based on PISA 2018 Science test results), analysed the frequency, magnitude and exposure of natural hazards of an extreme event character in selected countries and analysed the relationships between the education factor and WRI components among the countries. A detailed analysis was performed for 15 countries representing the full global range of natural hazards (frequency, magnitude and exposure to droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods (not related to hurricanes), mass movements, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis) and level of education. We found that the education factor (ranked and normalised to the maximal value among the considered countries) has significant negative correlation with the following WRI parameters: the Natural Hazard Factor (relative vulnerability, based on the difference between the relative and calculated WRI, ranked and normalised to the maximal value of WRI differences), susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptive capacities (all ranked and normalised to the maximal value). Results indicated that countries at low risk tend to be over-aware while countries at high risk are under-aware of natural hazards. Education can significantly increase awareness of natural hazards and reduce their impact.

ID RACE
AB Purpose: Over the past decade, increasing attention to the negative impacts of exclusionary discipline and disparities therein has led many state educational leaders to enact school discipline reforms. This study examined the response by school district leadership to a state's revision of guidelines for student codes of conduct. Data: This study leveraged longitudinal data on school district codes of conduct from the 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 school years across the state of Maryland. Codes of conduct were coded in an iterative fashion according to a common set of infraction-response combinations. Research Design: Using a pre-post analytic design, this study examined changes in districts' codified infractions, responses to infractions, and the overall tier of response. Furthermore, the study compared alignment between state guidelines and district codes of conduct while exploring variation in codified discipline across districts. Findings: Findings suggest that leaders in districts increased the number of response options available for most types of infractions, with the largest increases occurring for more serious infractions. While these increases tended to be driven by increases in the codification of less exclusionary responses, there were nevertheless sizeable increases in the availability of in-school suspension and removal/intervention. In almost all cases, school districts reported distributions of response options that were at a higher tier level than that recommended by the state. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in the context of current efforts to reform school discipline and the implications of such reform for implementation by district and school leadership.

AB With regard to the issue of the differences of the sexes, our study focuses on traditional games in Kabylie, taken and defined as part of the field of motor praxiology. A discipline inspired by the work of Pierre Parlebas. We will attempt through a field survey, to identify and interpret the meaning and distribution of the traditional games played by the women of Kabylie. From this perspective, the analysis of the internal logics of the practices are related to the system of interactions between players and their environment. This reveals valuable information on the structures underlying traditional games, and their ethno-motor characteristics as well as the world of ethnology of this vast mountainous region of Kabylie. By analyzing 92 traditional games played in the region of Kabylie allowed us to highlight on the one hand the cultural specificity, and on the other the richness of the socio-cultural aspects of this region. By examining how a game constitutes a cultural identity element of a geographical space, we explain the meaning of sport culture and identity of the Kabylie, by focusing particularly on the place of women and the indicators that reveal the relationships between men and women and distinguish the distribution of female and male roles. This also allows an understanding of the nature of traditional sports and their differentiation in terms of socialization between boys and girls.

AB We study whether the quality of the first job is lower for professional Asian nationals than for non-Asian nationals in the USA. With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance "burden of proof" from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.

AB We show that greater shareholder coordination, as proxied by the geographic proximity between institutional investors, is positively related to corporate innovation outcomes. This relationship is driven by coordination among dedicated and independent institutions who have strong monitoring incentives and is more pronounced among firms with lower blockholder ownership and greater information asymmetry where there is greater benefit to monitoring. We propose that shareholder coordination promotes corporate innovation through a reduction in managerial agency problems. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that greater shareholder coordination enables diffuse shareholders to monitor managers more effectively and enhances corporate innovation.

AB This research examines the influence of evolutionary motives on the modeling of food behavior. Across three studies, we demonstrate that the evolutionary motives of mate acquisition and mate retention influence relationship partners to model the food behaviors of their eating partners. We show that females, but not males, model the food behavior of an opposite sex eating partner under a mate acquisition evolutionary motive, while males, but not females, model the food behavior of an opposite sex eating partner under a mate retention evolutionary motive. Finally, we demonstrate that neither sex models food behavior under a parenting evolutionary motive. For marketers and policymakers, we offer recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of promotions targeted to couples or families.

AB Berenshtein and Zelevinskii provided an exhaustive list of pairs of weights (lambda,mu) of simple Lie algebras g (up to Dynkin diagram isomorphism) for which the multiplicity of the weight mu in the representation of g with highest weight lambda is equal to one. Using Kostant's weight multiplicity formula we describe and enumerate the contributing terms to the multiplicity for subsets of these pairs of weights and show that, in these cases, the cardinality of these contributing sets is enumerated by (multiples of) Fibonacci numbers. We conclude by using these results to compute the associated q-multiplicity for the pairs of weights considered, and conjecture that in all cases the q-multiplicity of such pairs of weights is given by a power of q.

AB We examine the mediating role of employees' affective well-being in the relationship between relationship conflict and counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and how this process varies based on their emotional intelligence (EI). Using a time-lagged survey design, we found that affective well-being mediates the relationship between relationship conflict and CWBO (CWB directed toward the organization) but not CWBI (CWB directed toward individuals). Furthermore, the positive indirect effect of relationship conflict on CWBO via affective well-being was significant for employees who have high levels of EI but not for those with low levels of EI.

AB Monitoring populations is critical to understanding habitat use, especially for endangered species and is important for determining the effectiveness of land management strategies. The Florida Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) is a critically endangered non-migratory grassland bird that has been monitored since the 1990s. It resides primarily in dry prairie habitat managed by frequent (2-3 years) prescribed fires. Monitoring is confounded by the presence of the migratory and wintering eastern Grasshopper Sparrow (A. s. pratensis), that has vocal and morphological similarities. These similarities could lead to misclassifications and erroneous conclusions about land management. Our goal was to determine the impact of fires on Florida Grasshopper Sparrow habitat use at two spatial scales, 100 m and 400 m buffers surrounding point count locations, while controlling for the presence of the eastern Grasshopper Sparrow. We combined point count data (1996-2011), external sources of data (eBird), and Bayesian dynamic occupancy models that accounted for misclassifications to evaluate habitat use and dynamics in response to prescribed fires. The probability of misclassifying a Florida Grasshopper Sparrow peaked in April and then decreased to near zero after May 1. The probability of persistence at point count stations decreased as years-since-fire (maximum of pixels within 400 m buffer) increased and was greatest for recent burns (< 1 year). Seasonality of the most recent burn (i.e., ordinal date of burn for pixels within 100 m buffer) also influenced probability of persistence with Florida Grasshopper Sparrows having greater-than-average persistence when burns occurred during January and July, peaking in early April. The probability of colonization peaked approximately two months after a fire and rapidly decreased to negligible values. This is the first long-term study to examine the effect of prescribed burn on Florida Grasshopper Sparrow occupancy that accounts for the presence of eastern Grasshopper Sparrows. This modeling framework may also provide utility for other species and subspecies that are difficult to distinguish during surveys.

   Apportionment Formulas?
SO PUBLIC FINANCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE state tax policy; state corporate income taxation; apportionment
AB Numerous states have altered the sales factor weight in their corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment formulas. We are among the first to examine which political and economic factors are important in determining whether and when states manipulate sales factor weights. We apply survival model techniques to a panel of state-level data for the years 1985-2012. Our most striking result is that a higher CIT rate is associated with faster movement to a higher sales factor weight. Perhaps indicating that, for economic development, states use sales factor manipulation in lieu of reducing CIT rates broadly, or alternatively, that states raise sales factor weights to compensate for higher statutory CIT rates. Results also indicate that stronger growth in the CIT base and in non-corporate tax revenues hasten sales factor weight increases. Democratic control of the state government and gubernatorial election years are also important in the timing of sales factor manipulation.

Effect of an 11-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness in young women. J Strength Cond Res 37(2): 315-321, 2023-The current investigation was conducted to determine the effect of 2 resistance training models on indices of arterial stiffness in young, healthy women. Twenty-four women, untrained college students, aged 18-22 years were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON) group (n = 8), high-intensity (HI) resistance exercise group (n = 8), and high-volume (HV) resistance exercise group (n = 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises 3-5 days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50-70% of 1RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.39 +/- 0.73 to 8.40 +/- 2.31 m center dot s(-1); p < 0.05) and carotid radial PWV (9.77 +/- 1.74 to 12.58 +/- 2.09 m center dot s(-1); p < 0.05) in the CON group alone. Both the HI and HV groups increased their maximum squat (36.6 +/- 7.9 vs. 41.3 +/- 31.8 percent change; p < 0.05), bench press (34.4 +/- 12.6 vs. 23.4 +/- 11.1 percent change; p < 0.05), and seated row (22.0 +/- 12.6 vs. 21.9 +/- 12.5 percent change; p < 0.05), respectively. Our findings support the use of resistance training exercise without undue impact on vascular compliance in otherwise healthy women.

AB We give a formula in terms of Young diagrams to calculate the minimum positive integer d such that q(d) appears in the quantum product of two Schubert classes for the submaximal isotropic Grassmannians in types B and C. We do this by studying curve neighborhoods. We compute curve neighborhoods in several combinatorial models including k-strict partitions and a set of partitions where their inclusion is compatible with the Bruhat order.

AB In this study, we examined the succession of soil microbial communities across a chronosequence of newly constructed salt marshes constructed primarily of fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Alpha diversity in the subsurface horizons was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while alpha diversity in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (similar to 24 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (similar to 30-67 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (Desulfobacterota), methanogens (Crenarchaeota, especially Methanosaeta), and fermenters (Chloroflexi and Clostridia) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially among Gammaproteobacteria, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structure may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.

AB Objective: To examine unique relations of three distinct dimensions of desirability of control with psychological and physical well-being and coping. Design: Study 1 (n = 122) surveyed undergraduates' response to everyday stressors, and Study 2 (n = 105) examined undergraduates' adjustment to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks at 1 and 3 months post-attack. Main outcome measures included psychological distress, perceived stress, rumination, health behaviors, alcohol use and active vs. avoidant coping. Study 1 Results: Self- and other-control were associated with active coping, whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Only relinquishing control was uniquely linked with outcomes, including worse psychological and physical well-being and alcohol use; avoidant coping mediated relations to psychological well-being. Study 2 Results: Again, self-control was associated with active coping whereas relinquishing control was linked with avoidant coping. Self-control was associated with enhanced psychological well-being at T1 and increases in well-being over time; by contrast, relinquishing control was associated with worse T1 psychological well-being, which was mediated by avoidant coping. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the unique contribution of each DOC dimension with outcomes. Self-control and relinquishing control showed divergent relations to psychological well-being, mediated by different coping pathways.

AB Mobile money (MM) enables users, especially the unbanked, to access financial services via mobile phones in developing countries. Whereas much has been studied about the socioeconomic benefits of MM in sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about whether and how MM use influences risk-taking behaviors such as gambling. This paper documents that MM use leads to the heightened probability of gambling and this probability increases with use frequency. Moreover, we find that young male MM users with a lower socioeconomic status (i.e., unemployed, low education, and low income) are more likely to engage in gambling. Our findings call for policymakers' attention to the potential for unintended consequence of MM.

AB Early and efficient detection of rare and invasive species is critical for the effective management of their populations. Environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques have been used for monitoring soft-bodied organisms (e.g., fishes) and some invertebrates, primarily in freshwater systems, but there are limited examples of eDNA as a method for monitoring marine crustaceans. The present study evaluates the efficacy of applying eDNA methods for detecting the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in a dynamic estuarine environment, and the effect of crab life stage (sex, molt stage, ovigery, abundance) on eDNA detection rates. An initial field experiment conducted in a local salt marsh system detected no C. maenas eDNA in sediment samples associated with traps containing C. maenas. In subsequent laboratory trials, aquaria containing one or two C. maenas at different life stages (soft-shell, hard-shell, male, female, ovigerous) were evaluated in replicated treatments to test the hypothesis that C. maenas exudes eDNA at higher levels when ovigerous, soft-shell, or at higher abundances. Duplicate sediment slurry and water samples were collected from each aquarium (n = 23) prior to crab addition (T-0), and after 24 h (T-1), 4 days (T-2), and 7 days (T-3). Sediment slurry and water samples were filtered, extracted, and analyzed using a species-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. In all non-control aquaria, C. maenas eDNA was detected, but concentrations were low (<10 copies/mu L) in non-ovigerous treatments. eDNA concentrations were significantly higher in sediment slurry versus water samples for male and ovigerous treatments. Overall, concentrations increased from T-0 to T-1 but did not significantly change from T-1 through T-3. The findings from this study indicate that during most of their life cycle, C. maenas shed low levels of DNA, highlighting the importance of considering life stage and sampling methodology when using eDNA to monitor crustaceans in estuarine environments.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the association between auditor industry specialization and accounting quality in the European Union (EU). Design/methodology/approach This study employs a difference-in-differences design and explores audit quality from different industry specialist perspectives and different accounting standard regimes. Specifically, this study examines accounting quality among audits performed by non-industry specialists, EU member country-level industry specialists (EUM-level), EU community-level industry specialists (EUC-level), as well as joint industry specialists. Findings This study finds evidence of an improvement in accounting quality among audits performed by non-industry specialists post-IFRS. There is also evidence of an improvement in accounting quality among audits performed by EUC-level industry specialists post-IFRS. In addition, accounting quality among audits performed by EUM-level industry specialists seems to be greater than that of audits performed by non-industry specialists in either the pre-IFRS period or the post-IFRS period. Overall, the mandatory adoption of IFRS in the EU appears to be associated with an improvement in accounting quality among some auditor groups. Research limitations/implications Industry specialization and accounting quality are not directly observable constructs; this study inevitably employs proxy measures for both. The findings of this study are location-specific and apply to mandatory IFRS adopters only. Practical implications This study informs regulators with respect to the importance of industry specialist auditors and financial reporting quality, particularly within the context of the EU. The findings suggest that industry specialists were a significant accounting quality determinant during the mandatory adoption of IFRS. The findings have implications for regulators in the EU and beyond. Originality/value This study is among the first to investigate the impact of auditor specialization on accounting quality in the EU, particularly in connection with the adoption of IFRS.

AB Most of our knowledge about the function, evolution, neurobiology and ontogeny of complex vocalizations in birds comes from previous work on male song. However, the recent increase in focus on female bird song over the last few decades has helped bridge that gap in our knowledge and has vastly changed our understanding of the function, phylogeny and evolution of bird song. Here we present evidence that female song may be modifiable based on signal function. Eastern bluebirds primarily use female song for within-pair communication with their social mate. We examined the female songs of eastern bluebirds sung during within-pair communication and compared the acoustic structure to female songs used in other contexts. Within-pair communication songs differed significantly from other female songs that we measured by six of the eight acoustic variables we measured. Additionally, we examined the song structure of within-pair communication songs at variable distances between mates and between neighbour females. Song structure did not vary over distance. However, we found significant differences between neighbouring females and the number of syllables and frequency modulations each female included in her within-pair communication songs. We propose that female songs have the potential to indicate individual identity, through acoustic structure modification. Our findings further highlight the need for additional study of female song and functional acoustic plasticity in bird song.

AB Purpose Drawing on the literature regarding the social network and stock investment, this paper aims to focus on the use of the social network on stock ownership decisions at individual levels. This paper also attempts to shed light on potential mediators of the relationship between the social network and stock ownership. Design/methodology/approach To determine the relationship between stock ownership and using the social network, logistic regression was used. In order to isolate the effect of using hs on stock ownership, a decomposing method was adopted. Findings The findings provide evidence of the positive contribution of the use of social networks in stock ownership. Personal characteristics, such as household net worth, homeownership, education level and risk tolerance, may play a vital role in influencing individuals' decisions regarding stock investment. In addition, this study contributes to our understanding of income's mediating role in stock investment decisions. Originality/value First, the authors contribute theoretically by drawing from the assumptions of social networking contagion theory, social influence theory, and social capital theory. Second, we explored potential mediators of the relationship between the social network and stock ownership. Third, this study complements the literature in incorporating the social network in business, financial professionals to be exact.

AB Although the influence of regulations on economic outcomes has been well documented, few studies have focused on the geography of regulatory burdens. The regulations confronting any supply chain can vary dramatically across legislative jurisdictions, as U.S. policy is enforced by overlapping federal, state, and local governments. We use a unique data set to explore state-by-state regulatory variation in U.S. beer supply chains in 2020. We find that the state-level rules targeted at the beer supply chain vary between 1,177 and 25,399, with the average state implementing 10,212 formal regulatory restrictions.

TI Equivariant quantum cohomology of the odd symplectic Grassmannian
SO MATHEMATISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA English
DT Article
AB The odd symplectic Grassmannian IG:=IG(k,2n+1) parametrizes k dimensional subspaces of C2n+1 which are isotropic with respect to a general (necessarily degenerate) symplectic form. The odd symplectic group acts on IG with two orbits, and IG is itself a smooth Schubert variety in the submaximal isotropic Grassmannian IG(k,2n+2). We use the technique of curve neighborhoods to prove a Chevalley formula in the equivariant quantum cohomology of IG,i.e.a formula to multiply a Schubert class by the Schubert divisor class. This generalizes a formula of Pech in the case k=2, and it gives an algorithm to calculate any multiplication in the equivariant quantum cohomology ring.

AB Strategies of navigation have been shown to play a critical role when animals revisit resource sites across large home ranges. The habitual route system appears to be a sufficient strategy for animals to navigate while avoiding the cognitive cost of traveling using the Euclidean map. We hypothesize that wild elephants travel more frequently using habitual routes to revisit resource sites as opposed to using the Euclidean map. To identify the elephants' habitual routes, we created a python script, which accounted for frequently used route segments that constituted the habitual routes. Results showed elephant navigation flexibility traveling at Kruger National Park landscape. Elephants shift strategies of navigation depend on the familiarity of their surroundings. In the core area of their home range, elephants traveled using the Euclidean map, but intraindividual differences showed that elephants were then converted to habitual routes when navigating within the less familiar periphery of their home range. These findings are analogous to the recent experimental results found in smaller mammals that showed that rats encode locations according to their familiarity with their surroundings. In addition, as recently observed in monkeys, intersections of habitual routes are important locations used by elephants when making navigation decisions. We found a strong association between intersections and new segment usage by elephants when they revisit resource sites, suggesting that intersection choice may contribute to the spatial representations elephants use when repeatedly revisiting resource sites.

AB A variety of countries have instituted market liberalisation to develop their economies in the footsteps of more developed countries and changes in market system significantly influence a firm's behaviour and performance. This paper investigates the impact of market liberalisation on a firm's strategy of technology exploration in South Korea. We find that there is a U-shaped relationship between market liberalisation and technology exploration. In addition, we find that financial slack and industry concentration negatively moderate the curvilinear relationship between market liberalisation and technology exploration, while business group positively moderates this relationship.

AB In the cause-related marketing (CM) literature, transparent communication of donation amounts (e.g., monetary donation quantifiers) has been shown to positively impact the effectiveness of CM campaigns. In practice, however, many firms communicate their donation contributions in more ambiguous terms (e.g., descriptive quantifiers). Across three studies, the authors demonstrate when using monetary quantifiers is less beneficial, due to consumers' skepticism of firm motives. Study 1 shows that the presence of a CM promotion positively affects perceptions of price fairness. Study 2 provides evidence that donation quantifier formats operate uniquely and impact price fairness through skepticism. Finally, Study 3 demonstrates ways in which practitioners can manage consumer skepticism, which affect perceptions of price fairness and ultimately purchase intent.

AB This paper estimates the local effects of a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program on income-based poverty rates in rural areas of Costa Rica between 2007-2009. Using household surveys and spatial geographic data, we are able to control for socioeconomic and geographic characteristics at the individual and census-tract level. Our results suggest that while payments did not affect poverty rates at the national level, poverty did increase in places where PES had the greatest effect on deforestation. This effect is stronger for uneducated males, who tend to work in agricultural activities. The trade-off between ecosystem services provision and poverty is not ubiquitous and, when present, could be addressed by targeting those groups that are most affected.

AB This paper examines the disparate impact of US federal regulations on small businesses. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model, we obtained two implications of higher regulation on small firms that have yet to be empirically tested in the published literature. First, as regulations increase, small firms' share of employment shrinks. Second, as regulations rise, small firms' share of total output falls. Using a panel of industry-specific US regulatory restrictions, we found that a 10% increase in federal regulations was associated with an approximate 0.8% reduction in small firms' share of industry employment and a nearly 1.5% decline in small firms' share of industry output.

AB While the respiratory tract is the primary route of entry for SARS-CoV-2, evidence shows that the virus also impacts the central nervous system. Intriguingly, case reports have documented SARS-CoV-2 patients presenting with demyelinating lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, suggesting possible implications in neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and other related neuroimmune disorders. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning these observations remain poorly defined. The goal of this paper was to review the literature to date regarding possible links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neuroimmune demyelinating diseases such as MS and its related disorders, with the aim of positing a hypothesis for disease exacerbation. The literature suggests that SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and orthologous murine coronaviruses invade the CNS via the olfactory bulb, spreading to connected structures via retrograde transport. We hypothesize that a glial inflammatory response may contribute to damaged oligodendrocytes and blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, allowing a second route for CNS invasion and lymphocyte infiltration. Potential for molecular mimicry and the stimulation of autoreactive T cells against myelin is also described. It is imperative that further studies on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion address the adverse effects of the virus on myelin and exacerbation of MS symptoms, as nearly 3 million people suffer from MS worldwide.

Based on the knowledge-based view and theory of intellectual capital, this research establishes a theoretical model to test the interrelationships among R&D investment, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and firm performance. We obtained seven years' panel data from two data centers, and applied mediation and moderation models to investigate the interrelationships. Our findings showwhile intellectual capital fully mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, organizational learning moderates the relationship between R&D investment and human capital. Our results show the important roles of intellectual capital and organizational learning in enhancing the effectiveness of R&D investment.

AB The quick service restaurant (QSR) industry operates in a highly competitive environment with close proximity, facilitating switching behavior. Therefore, QSRs have experimented with menus, developed personalized experiences, and pioneered new methods of ordering and delivery to improve sales and revenue. A less used method by QSRs is managing social media resources, particularly electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), to obtain competitive advantage. This paper explores the effect of in-store engagement in the form of geolocated social media messages containing product-brand mentions in QSRs by combining data from multiple digital data sources. This research supports the ideas that parasocial (not face-to-face) interactions such as likes, retweets, and replies fully mediate the effect of in-store engagement on local competitor visits over the next 30 days, and that the direction of this effect can vary with competitor density in the location. This research suggests how QSRs can use social media to improve local market positions.

TI Establishing the relationship between non-human primates and mangrove

SO PLOS ONE

AB Global and spatially explicit information about the interaction between habitat and wildlife species is critical to enhancing conservation efforts. Despite the recognized importance of mangrove forests to non-human primates, the relationship between the two lacks understanding. To counter this, we created the MangPrim-21 database to map and measure the locations of interactions between all non-human primates and all mangrove forests globally. We report our findings across the global, national, and local scales for all inventoried non-human primates and all inventoried mangrove forests. Globally, we find that half of all non-primates potentially use mangrove forests, and more than half of the global mangrove forest falls within the delineated range of at least one non-human primate species. Nationally, we find that Indonesia, Madagascar, Brazil, Cameroon, and Malaysia likely have the most non-human primate and mangrove forest interactions. At the subnational level, we find that several discrete locations in Kalimantan are critical to both mangrove forests and non-human primates. The MangPrim-21 database provides a globally consistent and locally applicable database of non-human primate and mangrove forest interactions. The results presented have broader implications for non-human primate and mangrove conservation and global actions to protect both. Additionally, our results raise questions about the idea that non-human primates primarily use mangrove forests as a refuge from human encroachment and habitat degradation.

TI The ownership effect on corporate investment distortion in the

SO REVIEW OF QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING

DE Corporate ownership; Investment distortion; Entrenchment; Asymmetric
   information; G32; L21; P31
AB This article analyzes how asymmetric information in corporate management and equity financing distorts corporate investment and how different corporate ownership (government, managerial, and foreign) affects investment distortion in a transitional economy. When managerial entrenchment is sufficiently high, government ownership further distorts investment by biasing downward managers' net marginal cost of investment; in contrast, managerial and foreign ownership counter the bias and thereby reduce investment distortion. Furthermore, unlike government ownership, managerial and foreign ownership mitigate rather than exacerbate the extent to which high entrenchment distorts investment. An econometric analysis of a large sample of Chinese public firms provides strong evidence in support of these theoretical predictions.

ID PREDICTION
AB The automobile consumption credit business promotes the development of the automobile industry. However, the current credit system in China requires further refinement. Thus, the credit loan business is associated with certain risks, and company profits are often negatively impacted by clients who default on loans. Based on the data, this article leverages the economic and financial theories of consumer credit risk control to construct a logistic model to predict customers' default probability. Then, a quadratic regression model is established to determine the optimal commission structure to balance profitability with incentives from retail stores. Results show that the macro-level variables are negatively associated with the probability of good behavior. The personal level variables exhibit a positive association. In addition, a negative coefficient in the quadratic profit equation indicates the presence of an inverted "U" relationship between profit and commission. Corresponding suggestions are put forward.

AB Muslim women experience gendered Islamophobia because their Muslim identity is often more visible and comes to symbolize their culture. Experiencing discrimination can cause stress and negative mental health outcomes. However, Muslim identity can also be a source of coping, and the Muslim community can be a source of support in the face of Islamophobia. We hypothesized that openness about identity within the Muslim community may differ based on gender and that experiences of discrimination would be associated with a desire to hide one's Muslim identity in public for women but not for men. Seventy-three Muslim college students were recruited through snowball sampling in a cross-sectional survey in North America. Mean differences and correlational patterns were compared between women (n = 35) and men (n = 30). Correlational and regression analyses revealed that for women but not men, discrimination was correlated with hiding one's Muslim identity in public. Microagressions and offence at Trump's proposed travel ban were related to openness with other Muslims for women only. Women were more offended than men by Trump's statement but only after President Trump took office. Intersectionality needs to be unpacked to better understand the multidimensional nature of gendered Islamophobia and racist policy actions.

It is based on decoupling correlated stock price process and volatility process so that corresponding partial differential operator does not contain the mixed partial derivative term. Hence, the proposed method is numerically simple and fast. Numerical results are presented to examine the accuracy of the proposed method and to compare it with the others.

AB Habitat loss and degradation affect populations in isolation while also modifying the intensity of interspecific interactions, which may be especially relevant for species of conservation concern coexisting with more common species. We explored habitat preferences and potential interspecific resource competition in the endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata). For habitat data, water quality measurements were recorded once per trapping session, while canopy cover and vegetation data were recorded once per field season. We also investigated niche overlap in habitat and food resources between C. guttata and other, more common, turtle species. Our data indicated that the abundance of C. guttata was negatively correlated with dissolved O-2 and pH levels and positively correlated with body of water depth and canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum) and Painted Turtles ( Chrysemys picta), but not Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), were negatively correlated with the abundance of C. guttata despite differences in characteristics of bodies of water used by each species. We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences. We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles and ultimately found that all species had similar, broad diets. The inverse relationship between abundance of C. guttata and other species, paired with the overlap in dietary niche space, suggests there is potential for interspecific interactions to negatively impact the abundance of C. guttata within turtle communities on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The results of this study highlight that management efforts may need to consider that species of conservation concern coexist with more common species, especially as habitat loss decreases the breadth of habitat available.

AB This paper presents the first results from draw-a-scientist tests (DASTs) over five years that were used to measure the effect of 8-10 week long astronomy clubs and week long summer camps on 3 rd-5 th grade elementary school students' perceptions of scientists. We facilitated these DASTs prior to these clubs or camps, which provide a baseline for a student's initial conception of scientists, and once at the end, to determine whether their conception changed, possibly as a result of their involvement. In total we analyze 89 pairs of DASTs using a numerical grading scheme designed to quantify the presence of various features in the drawn scientist and their activities. We find that there is a gender imbalance in both the pre- and postclub drawings, with only 32% and 35%, respectively, of students drawing female scientists. We also find that a third to a half of the scientists have a stereotypical appearance and/or are performing stereotypical activities. Although we find insignificant changes (<5%) in most categories, we do find an 8% increase in the number of scientists that have a stereotypical appearance, which is worth following up, but a significant 12% decrease in the number of scientists who are performing stereotypical activities. In addition, we present some possible improvements to implementing DASTs and discuss other possible assessments that could provide a more direct method of gauging the effect of these astronomy clubs or camps.

AB The natural curiosity of young children, makes the preschool period an important time for introducing and reinforcing engineering practices. Engineering here is defined as goal-oriented thinking that addresses problems and decisions within constraints by drawing on available resources. Engineering encompasses hands-on activity, inquiry, teamwork, and other instructional practices that develop children's critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. However, exposure to engineering in early childhood education is mostly incidental, rather than exclusively through engineering. Further, while there is an emerging body of literature on engineering curricula and activities in early childhood, little information is provided about what preschool engineering looks like, as well as reflections from such implementation. The purpose of this study was to implement engineering challenges in a preschool classroom framed in an inquiry-based teaching approach, and to document teacher reflections and lessons learned. The study was conducted in a private preschool program for students aged 3-5, including children with or at-risk for developmental delays. Thirteen preschool students and one preschool teacher participated in this study, wherein, four engineering activities were implemented in the classroom over a four-week period. The teacher's reflections reveal the importance of engineering activities in providing a platform for preschool students with diverse needs to work together, practice skills from a multitude of domains, and engage in authentic peer interactions. Implications for early childhood educators seeking to incorporate engineering experiences in their classroom are shared. Recommendations for practice including how preschool students can meaningfully participate in similar inquiry-driven activities as well as the teacher's role in supporting their participation is discussed.

AB As societies become more concerned with environmental protection, some firms go beyond their legal obligations and proactively adopt their own green management practices even if those practices cannot produce short-term benefits. As a result, researchers have begun to question the underlying motives of these firms. Leveraging corporate loss aversion, we argue that firms that outperform their peers become more risk-seeking to avoid any future loss of competitive advantage. As a result, they become more likely to engage in stakeholder management in the form of green management practices. Specifically, we explore the Green Power Partnership (GPP) which solicits firms to purchase green power. Using the data for the green power consumed by firms that are participating in the GPP program in the United States, we find that firms with performance above social aspiration are likely to increase their use of green power. We also find that related diversification has a negative influence on such motivation.

TI Frequency of Opioid Prescribing for Acute Low Back Pain in a Rural

DE acute low back pain; low back pain; opioid prescribing
AB National guidelines created by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and the American College of Physicians (ACP) support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over opioids when treating acute low back pain (AHRQ, 2016;Harrison, 2017;Qaseem, Wilt, McLean, Forciea, & Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians, 2017). Opioids not only have many more side effects than NSAIDs but also carry the risk of opioid abuse and overdose (Qaseem et al., 2017). The purpose of this study was to determine whether emergency department (ED) providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, are following evidence-based low back pain management guidelines by assessing the measurement of opioid versus NSAID prescribing. A retrospective chart review including data from January through June 2017 was conducted at a rural ED. Subject inclusion criteria were as follows: older than 18 years, had experienced new-onset low back pain within the last 1 month, and had been given anICD-10(International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code of M54.5. Data regarding the type of provider seen, the treatment the provider prescribed, and demographics were collected. Inclusion criteria were met by 162 subjects. While 52.5% of subjects were prescribed an NSAID at discharge, 53.7% were prescribed an opioid at discharge. Subjects whose injury was work related were less likely to receive an opioid prescription (p= 0.027, 95% CL). Subjects whose pain started within 3 days were more likely to receive an opioid prescription than those whose pain had started more than 3 days before being seen (p= 0.018, 95% CL). Despite the current evidence-based guidelines by the AHRQ, ACEP, and ACP against opioid prescribing for acute low back pain, more subjects received an opioid prescription at discharge than a prescription for an NSAID. This retrospective chart review determined the need for increased ED provider education regarding treatment modalities for acute low back pain.

AB In 1998, Montgomery County, Maryland adopted a local earned income tax credit (EITC) program. We use U.S Vital Statistics data covering births in Maryland from 1995 to 2004 to examine whether the local EITC impacted birth weight and the probability of low birth weight in Montgomery County. Using difference-in-differences (DD) and triple differences (DDD) strategies, we find that the Montgomery County EITC decreased the probability of low birth weight by 1.9 to 2.4 percentage points among likely eligible mothers. Using the local credit as a unique opportunity to identify EITC EITC effects within a state, these estimates contribute to a growing body of literature that finds improved birth outcomes for credit recipients.

DE Beds; Sleep; Back Pain; Mechanical Phenomena

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the firmness of used mattress coil springs from the areas bearing greatest body weight versus areas subjected to little compression.Methods: Weight-bearing springs (WBS) extracted from the center of the mattresses (N = 32), and non-weightbearing springs (NWBS) extracted from the head/foot were of the same mattresses. To determine spring weakness, a 1296-g ingot was placed on the coil, and the compression distance was measured (cm). In addition, a gauge was used to measure the amount of pressure required to compress the coil springs a distance of 2 cm. Comparison between WBS and NWBS data were statistically treated using independent t tests and a 1-way analysis of variance.Results: There were no significant group differences in weight or height in unloaded coils. However, there were significant (P < .05) differences in coil spring compression distance under load (WBS = 2.78 +/- 0.34 cm; NWBS = 1.52 +/- 0.39 cm) and force gauge compression (WBS = 1090.51 +/- 88.42 g; NWBS = 1213.12 +/- 71.38 g) between groups.Conclusion: This study found that WBSs were weaker when compressed than the NWBS from used mattresses, and such characteristics may not be visually apparent in a mattress when not in use. Thus, coil springs in bedding systems may eventually fail to provide the initial structural support after use. Such sagging may compromise sleep posture with accompanying poor sleep quality and quantity. (J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2022;45;323-328)

AB Purpose As fake information has become the norm on the internet, it is important to investigate how skepticism impacts an individual's attitude toward word-of-mouth (eWOM). This study examines eWOM skepticism via three dimensions: suspicion of motivation, suspicion of truthfulness and suspicion of identity. It investigates not only which of the three dimensions is more influential in eWOM situations but also the variations and relationships among these three. Furthermore, this study evaluates how an individual's dispositional trust and perceptions regarding structural assurance can impact each dimension, which in turn affects the assessment of the eWOM messages' credibility. Design/methodology/approach Using an online scenario-based survey, data were collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk from 195 participants in the U.S. PLS and cluster analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings The results reveal that the suspicion of identity play a major role in message credibility assessment and that people who are naturally less likely to trust others also hold higher suspicion of motivation and truthfulness. Further, structural assurance has significant negative effects on all three dimensions. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of enhancing the protective measures on eWOM platforms and call for stricter regulations to prevent organizations from adopting deceptive eWOM propagandas. Originality/value This research contributes to the literature by exploring the impact of skepticism on eWOM message credibility assessment and helping to validate this newly created construct by considering eWOM skepticism as a formative construct.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how firms can develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events, by developing big data analytics (BDA) capabilities within their organization. The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm's ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. Findings The analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm's ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization's existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization's ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events. Originality/value This study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. The study further provides a counterpoint to the existing perspective within the supply chain risk management literature that institutional experience of managing past supply chain disruption events prepares the organization to deal with future disruption events. This paper adds to our understanding of how, by adopting BDA capabilities, firms can develop supply chain risk resilience from disruption events.

AB A new mathematical model of neural networks described by diffusive FitzHugh-Nagumo equations with memristors and linear synaptic coupling is proposed and investigated. The existence of absorbing set for the solution semiflow in the energy space is proved and global dynamics of the memristive neural networks are dissipative. Through uniform estimates and maneuver of integral inequalities on the interneuron difference equations, it is shown that exponential synchronization of the neural network at a uniform convergence rate occurs if the coupling strength satisfies a threshold condition explicitly expressed by the system parameters, which is illustrated and verified by numerical simulations. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Because religion is important in the lives of many Americans, psychology should study religious behavior as it does other areas of human functioning. With the increased emphasis upon diversity, this should be reflected in the extent to which psychology of religion courses are offered. The current study examined the extent to which psychology of religion courses were offered in the undergraduate curriculum and the knowledge gained by students who take this course. The results suggested there has been no increase in the proportion of psychology of religion courses offered at the undergraduate level, in contrast to increases in these courses at the graduate level. This study also found there was a gain in the scientific knowledge of psychology of religion for students who took this course relative to another course in psychology. This study suggests that perhaps more courses of this nature should be offered to undergraduate students.

Data was analyzed, themed, and coded.ResultsA thematic analysis of the descriptions of wellness revealed 2 higher-ordered themes as whole-person and wellbeing, and 3 lower-ordered themes of balance, interconnectedness, and personalized in relation to participants' understanding of wellness.ConclusionsThe importance of balance between wellness dimensions and the acknowledgment of the interconnectedness of wellness dimensions are related to quality of life and life satisfaction. A deeper insight is needed to better understand the perceptions of wellness in this population to provide more effective interventions. This can be achieved through the development of enhanced pedagogy, which may improve student health.

AB In today's increasingly volatile world, organisations including healthcare providers need interfirm dynamic capabilities to make timely responses to supply chains changes. There has been a wealth of literature on dynamic capabilities; however, very few are at interfirm level and even fewer are conducted in the healthcare industry. Grounded in information processing view, this study contributes to the literature by examining interfirm dynamic capabilities in the context of healthcare delivery networks. It proposes the interfirm dynamic capabilities as a form of information processing capability with five dimensions: sensing, learning, coordination, collective mind and partner development. Using data collected from healthcare delivery networks, this study explores the impact of interfirm dynamic capabilities on hospitals' performance. The findings suggest that the fit between a healthcare delivery network's interfirm dynamic capabilities and information processing requirements will improve its operational capabilities, which will lead to better performance.

AB Changes in forest size and composition can affect Neotropical migratory songbirds breeding in Eastern North America, leading to population fluctuations and declines. In 2012-2014, we conducted point counts at locations previously surveyed in 1981-1983 and analysed Breeding Bird Atlas data from 1980-2013 to estimate long-term population trends of two declining ground-nesting warblers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland within the Atlantic Coastal Plain: the Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and the Worm-eating Warbler Helmitheros vermivorum. We detected significant declines for Ovenbirds in both datasets, but we found conflicting data for Worm-eating Warblers. During 2012-2015, we investigated the effects of forest characteristics, such as vegetative composition and ground cover, on occupancy and nest success. Ovenbirds were found more where there were more and larger trees but were negatively affected by the proportion of pines, whereas Worm-eating Warblers were more abundant when there were higher numbers of trees and more pines. Nest success was not affected by vegetation other than the proportion of pine trees or leaf litter depth, both of which increased nest success. Worm-eating Warblers with more pine needles in their nests also had increased nest success. This study presents a nuanced view of how forest composition (proportion of pine trees) of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland influenced ground-nesting warblers differently, and suggests that effectively managing ground-nesting warblers in this area may differ from other regions of Eastern North America due to its unique vegetative composition, structure, and history.

AB Nowadays, a growing number of firms utilize corporate lobbying to advocate for more environmentally friendly policies and regulations, deviating from the traditional lobbying mainly used to minimize regulatory burdens. In this study, we investigate what motivates firms to engage in such an unusual type of lobbying-environmental lobbying. Focusing on the product strategy of firms, we suggest that firms with greater green product intensity are more likely to engage in environmental lobbying. When environmental lobbying raises environmental hurdles in the market, firms with an intensive focus on green products can bear adjustment costs with little effort, leaving other "less green" firms relatively disadvantaged under the newly regulated market conditions. Moreover, those firms can address demand-side issues more easily by lobbying the government to provide greater incentives for purchasing green products or to request subsidies that can be used to improve their cost structure. Our analyses based on the US light vehicle market indicate that, indeed, the more electric vehicles automakers sell relative to their total sale volumes, the more they will engage in environmental lobbying. We also find that this relationship becomes more salient when a firm has greater market share or originally comes from a foreign country with more stringent environmental regulations than the United States.

AB Business students have long been noted for their differential proclivity to engage in academic misconduct. Unfortunately, the potential for misconduct has been exacerbated in recent years by rapid advances in technology, easy access to information, competitive pressures, and the proliferation of websites that provide students access to information that allows them to directly circumvent the learning process. Using a convenience sample of 631 students matriculating in various business majors at four U.S. universities and structural equations modeling procedures, this study assesses the effects of psychological factors on business students' propensities to utilize the services of homework assistance websites. Specifically, we examine how "Dark Triad" personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) interact with Fraud Diamond elements to influence student decisions to engage the services of these websites. We find that each Dark Triad trait exerts a significant influence on at least one of the Fraud Diamond elements, which in turn have a significant direct or indirect positive association with students' reported intentions to utilize, and reported utilization of, these websites.

AB This study is the first to measure the impact of federal regulations on consumer prices. By combining consumer expenditure and pricing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, industry supply-chain data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and industry-specific regulation information from the Mercatus Center's RegData database, we determine that regulations promote higher consumer prices, and that these price increases have a disproportionately negative effect on low-income households. Specifically, we find that the poorest households spend larger proportions of their incomes on heavily regulated goods and services prone to sharp price increases. While the literature explores other specific costs of regulation, noting that higher consumer prices are a probable consequence of heavy regulation, this study is the first to provide a thorough empirical analysis of that relationship across industries. Irrespective of the reasons for imposing new regulations, these results demonstrate that in the aggregate, the negative consequences are significant, especially for the most vulnerable households.

AB Past experiences influence choices, and people's preferences for more similar (habit-forming) or different (variety-seeking) experiences are reflected in these choices. We develop a structural estimation framework to capture whether people are habit forming or variety seeking and apply it to the choice of recreation site. This research contributes to the revealed preference literature by demonstrating how to account for habit or variety-seeking behavior in recreation site choice models in a two-stage framework. Using this framework, we estimate similarity weights that reflect the birders habit formation and variety seeking preferences. Predicted probabilities from the first stage model are then incorporated into the second stage, a mixed logit recreation site choice model of bird watching trips from eBird, by their members. We find that including the dynamic elements of choice, specifically variety-seeking behavior, can double the estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for individual sites relative to the static model. Although our sample of bird watching trips taken by eBird members is a sample of convenience, these results suggest that static models of recreation site choice are a lower bound on our recreation demand WTP estimates. We find variety-seeking preferences are related to land cover and the site's fixed attributes, whereas habit formation appears for seasonality in the bird watching context.

AB Increasingly, creating and delivering value through complex supply chain networks involves substantial risks. However, strategy development under business risk conditions is not well-understood. This cross-country research examines how, under conditions of supply chain network risk, firms develop effective risk management practices. Using a literature review and survey research of managers from global firms; we present a research model, and empirically test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that under conditions of uncertainty, management decision-making is more likely to be cautious until visible forms of risks emerge, and prudent response mechanisms are put in place. This study identifies the crucial role of supply chain exploration and exploitation practices, and their influence in development of network risk management practices, leading to competitive financial outcomes.

ID COOPERATIVE TRANSPORT; ASSEMBLAGES
AB Many ants can cooperatively transport large food items (either coordinated or uncoordinated during transportation), which can be rarely observed in other animals besides humans. Although these behaviors have been extensively investigated on horizontal surfaces, few studies dealt with food transport on vertical surfaces. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is an invasive ant species that commonly forages on trees. Our studies showed that S. invicta used multiple strategies to transport food items on vertical surfaces (tree trunks). Small food items (1 x 1 x 1 mm sausage) were carried and transported by individual ants, and larger food items were either collectively and directly transported or cut collaboratively first and small particles were then transported individually or collectively. Competition and deadlocks were frequently observed during individual and collective transport respectively. During cutting, groups of ants tightly fixed the food on the tree trunks by holding the edges of the food item, while other ants cut the food into smaller particles. All food items and particles were moved downward. We investigated the effects of food placement (placed on a platform or fixed on tree trunk), food shape (cuboid or flattened), particle sizes (0.45-1, 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4 mm), and placement height (20, 80, or 150 cm) on the food transport on tree trunks. Our studies are the first to show how fire ants transport food on a vertical surface, and may provide insights into the development of novel fire ant baiting systems that can be placed on tree trunks.

AB Analysts' decision-making process, through which they use earnings and non-earnings forecasts to provide their target price revisions, remains opaque. Based on the decision tree analysis, we develop a new multivariate information metric, Internal Relevance (IR), to measure the extent to which the revisions of analysts' consensus earnings and sales forecasts are incorporated into the revisions of consensus target prices. We show that stocks with higher IR have stronger market reactions to target price revisions in terms of abnormal return, abnormal trading volume, and abnormal return volatility. These results remain consistent across a series of robustness checks. Finally, we perform portfolio analysis to show that IR can be used to screen stocks to improve trading profitability.

AB Firms are increasingly transforming themselves into agile enterprise by integrating and exploiting digital technologies. Prior research has suggested organization mindfulness would help proactively manage digital technologies and reduce the possibility of rigidity resulting from digital technologies. Although the key role of organizational mindfulness has been increasingly recognized, the impact of organizational mindfulness towards digital transformation on developing digital technology enabled information processing capacity (IPC) has not been empirically examined. In this study, we conceptualize digital technology enabled IPC based on the information processing view (IPV) and examine the relationships among organizational mindfulness, IPC, and market agility. Empirical findings from our survey of 102 managers of US companies indicates that digital transformation-mindful organizations are more likely to effectively establish a digital technology infrastructure; digital technology-enabled external and internal relationships and digital technology-business strategic alignment which, in turn, enhances their ability to respond to environmental turbulence in the markets promptly.

AB Rodents are known to signal using odors to communicate information including their sex, age, reproductive state, and unique identity. Conspecifics can recognize these signals and behaviorally respond in sex-specific ways. However, we know little about how males and females might differ in their responses to signals from individuals or how the sexes might differ in their ability to recognize their own identity. Such signals of identity are important because they can modulate the behavior of receivers, and allow for responses related to aggression, territory maintenance, affiliation, and reproduction. To assess how males and females might differ in their responses to individual familiar and novel social signals, and their own individual signals compared to novel same-sex conspecifics, we tested southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) using a habituation-discrimination paradigm. Only females showed individual recognition and discriminated among males, preferring novel males. Females also discriminated between their own scent and a novel conspecific odor. Males did not discriminate or demonstrate individual recognition. Male and female differences in response to opposite-sex odors demonstrated that males do not discriminate between familiar and novel reproductively available females, but females discriminate and prefer to investigate novel males.

AB Knowledge of population dynamics is critical for species of conservation concern so wildlife researchers need to take advantage of biases in animals' behaviors that could help them monitor populations. This is particularly important for amphibians because many populations are declining and difficult to observe. Attraction of vertebrates to light is a well-known navigational cue and some fisheries strategies utilize light sources to increase catch success. To optimize population monitoring of state-endangered eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), we tested the utility of colored glow sticks (green, orange, pink, or yellow) as bait in traps in Maryland and Delaware, USA, during 2015-2016. We then measured intensities of the colored glow sticks and estimated photoreceptive quantum catches of each color according to the spectral sensitivities of eastern tiger salamanders. We found that eastern tiger salamanders' photoreceptors had greater quantum catches of photons from green and yellow glow sticks. However, traps baited with orange glow sticks were more than twice as likely to capture eastern tiger salamanders than were traps baited with green or yellow. There were no differences in the number of salamanders caught per successful trap among glow stick colors, perhaps due to attraction of salamanders to motion from previously captured salamanders. Our results indicate that biases other than perceived intensity of light sources may drive behavioral preferences. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.

   CONTEXT
AB This study examines the extent to which male and female principal candidates use language to signal their perceived values specific to open positions in the field. We analyzed Wisconsin school-leader application data by gender, seeking to understand whether or not men and women present themselves differently through language in the initial application phase. Using an electronic linguistic analysis tool (Docuscope), we identified patterns in the writing samples from 2,061 applicants and applied critical discourse analysis to determine the role gender plays in candidates' portrayals of themselves. This mixed-methods approach revealed that language use differs significantly between male and female applicants. Notably, linguistic variables common in female candidates' writing tend to focus on elaborating ideas and using compare/contrast techniques to describe beliefs. Male applicants' language is often more formal and relies heavily on passive voice. Our findings raise questions as to whether candidates may be selected because of an unconscious preference for language patterns commonly used by females or males.

AB Food regulations protect consumer health, mitigate environmental concerns, and promote animal welfare, but they can also hinder innovation, limit entrepreneurship, and generate higher consumer prices. This study examines the number of federal and state regulatory restrictions affecting the beef, pork, poultry, sheep, goat, and seafood industries, including processing, wholesale distribution, and retail sales. We also examine state regulatory heterogeneity associated with animal protein products. Our results suggest that protein supply chains have become subject to tens of thousands of regulatory constraints over the past half-century. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the number of state restrictions associated with animal production, indicative of large differences in the amount of administrative law across states. Results highlight that the patchwork approach of U.S. food policy creates overlapping, cumbersome guidelines for manufacturers, and given the interconnectivity of modern food supply chains, the framework can create additional hurdles for interstate commerce.

AB With the backdrop of the utility of grit at the individual level, speculation has begun to circulate that grit may exist as an organizational level phenomenon. To explore this potential construct, this study used an exploratory, qualitative research design. This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders' perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: "What do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?" Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.

AB A key trend in the 210-million-year-old history of modern turtles was the evolution of shell kinesis, that is, shell movement during neck and limb retraction. Kinesis is hypothesized to enhance predator defense in small terrestrial and semiaquatic turtles and has evolved multiple times since the early Cretaceous. This complex phenotype is nonfunctional and far from fully differentiated following embryogenesis. Instead, kinesis develops slowly in juveniles, providing a unique opportunity to illustrate the postembryonic origins of an adaptive trait. To this end, we examined ventral shell (plastral) kinesis in emydine box turtles and found that hatchling plastron shape differs from that of akinetic-shelled relatives, particularly where the hinge that enables kinesis differentiates. We also demonstrated shape changes relative to plastron size in juveniles, coinciding with a shift in the carapace-plastron structural connection, rearrangement of ectodermal plates, and bone repatterning. Furthermore, because the shell grows larger relative to the head, complete concealment of the head and extremities is only achieved after relative shell proportions increase. Structural alterations that facilitate the box turtle's transformation are probably prepatterned in embryos but require function-induced changes to differentiate in juveniles. This mode of delayed trait differentiation is essential to phenotypic diversification in turtles and perhaps other tetrapods.

Participants' reported strategy use during reading, as measured by self-regulated learning microanalysis, was significantly related to scores on a self-regulated learning questionnaire. Self-monitoring on the microanalytic protocol was significantly related to a measure of metacognitive monitoring as well as to participants' item-level confidence judgments. Participants who made strategy attributions for performance tended to have higher scores on the measure of reading comprehension. Strategic planning and strategy use during reading of the text also predicted comprehension. Implications and future directions for the study of self-regulated learning microanalysis are discussed.

AB Emerging evidence suggests that executive function plays an important role in adult readers' understanding of text. This study examined the contribution of executive function to comprehension of expository science text among adult readers, as well as the role of vocabulary ability in the relation between executive function and text comprehension. The roles of additional reader characteristics, including age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability, in comprehension were also examined. Using structural equation modeling, a latent executive function factor significantly predicted comprehension after accounting for age, reading time, prior knowledge, and vocabulary ability. Vocabulary ability mediated the relation between executive function and both lower-level and higher-level reading comprehension. Executive function contributed more strongly to lower-level compared with higher-level comprehension of the text. Implications for future research are discussed.

TI Watching you descend, I help others rise: the influence of leader

AB The fundamental nature of humility and prosocial motivation entails transcending self-interest to enact behaviors that benefit others. We theorize that leader humility may enact a self-transcendent contagion effect that will manifest in enhanced follower prosocial motivation. Due to the fundamental nature of humility, this construct holds great promise in understanding how contextual signals (i.e., leader behaviors) shape prosocial motivation in followers. In this study, we find that leader humility impacts follower prosocial motivation through followers' perception of work meaningfulness. Specifically, we found that leader humility is positively related to prosocial motivation. We also found that this relationship is mediated by followers' perception of work meaningfulness, and that this mediation is moderated by followers' perception of relational vitality. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI Social Work Education Anti-Racism (SWEAR) Scale
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Social work education programs in the U.S. are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Amendments made to the 2022 competencies reflect antiracism language, which requires assessment opportunities in the classroom moving forward. An assessment tool that assesses efficacy across the four domains, specifically related to antiracism, is essential for practice readiness, assessment, and accountability for future professional social workers. This article presents the Social Work Education Anti-Racism Scale to help programs assess their progress toward preparing social work students to become practitioners who embrace antiracism. The final scale included 30 items on five subscales related to antiracism: knowledge, values, skills, cognitive and affective processes, and professional responsibility. Applications for accredited social work programs are discussed.

AB In our contribution to this special issue on "Chronotopes & the COVID-19 Pandemic", we discuss the complexities of human survival and its dependence on collective learning. We argue that collective learning - and thus survival - is a sociolinguistic phenomenon and lay out a fractal system in which the related sociolinguistic processes play out. This system highlights the chronotopic-scalar situatedness of survival and captures the material, textual, and imagined aspects of learning and meaning-making. Drawing on interactions among a small group of Iranian migrants dealing with the effects of COVID-19, we discuss the processes through which participants dynamically construct and update their chronotopic images of their new circumstances, as they interact with material and semiotic data coming from multiple scales/centers. We show how the normative-semiotic indeterminacies caused by COVID-19 are navigated by social actors as they make sense of their spatiotemporal surroundings in pursuit of material and ideological survival.

AB Primary care services are cornerstones for US health care, assuring preventive screening, maintenance of therapeutics, and access to specialty care. Sexual minority (SM) adults are less likely to have access to primary care services than their heterosexual counterparts. Additionally, access to health services among SM persons can vary by age. One plausible explanation for these disparities are experiences of minority stress. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the association between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services among SM people in the United States across multiple age cohorts. A series of logistic regressions examined associations among multiple experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Analyses, stratified by age cohort, examined associations between experiences of minority stress and access to primary care services. Felt stigma, on average, was negatively associated with having a primary care provider among the full sample. The stratified analysis revealed that higher rates of felt stigma were negatively associated with having a primary care provider only among younger SM adults. This study offers novel information suggesting that unique experiences of minority stress are linked with barriers in access to primary care services among SM people.

AB Surface treatment is commonly used in controlling the red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren. In the present study, the behavioral responses of S. invicta workers to surfaces treated with insecticides were investigated. Toxicological tests showed that beta-cypermethrin had the highest contact toxicity (with the lowest LC50 value) among nine tested insecticides, followed by thiamethoxam, fipronil, indoxacarb, chlorfenapyr, spinetoram, rotenone, avermectin, and chlorantraniliprole. In the laboratory, surfaces treated with beta-cypermethrin or rotenone significantly reduced the number of foraging ants. In addition, S. invicta workers transported significantly more particles (measured in weight and/or covered area) onto surfaces treated with fipronil (50, 500, and 5000 mu g/mL), rotenone (5000 mu g/mL), or avermectin (5000 mu g/mL) compared with the controls. Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field. We hypothesized that such behaviors would reduce the contact toxicity of insecticides against S. invicta. When the surfaces treated with fipronil or rotenone (500 or 5000 mu g/mL) were artificiality covered with particles, S. invicta had significantly higher LT50 values compared with insecticide-treated surfaces without particles. This study provides the first evidence that S. invicta workers can perform particle-covering behavior to reduce the toxicity of certain insecticides, which constitutes a unique insecticide-resistance strategy in ants.

AB In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertize accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered "adults" by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a "flexible" reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRHagonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.

ID CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; TEACHING SCIENCE; CLASSROOM; INSTRUCTION; PLAY
AB Preschool children have the capacity to engage in scientific practices and inquiry and develop understanding at a conceptual level. While engaging in inquiry with preschool students, teachers transition from being transmitters of knowledge to facilitators in the educational process as students take on an active role in this learner-centered approach. Although studies have explored how preschool students can engage in inquiry-based science, there is a dearth of research on what teachers need to do to ensure their students are engaging in meaningful, inquiry-based science. Considering the nature of preschool students' play-curious exploration throughout the day-this study sought to review the literature on preschool scientific inquiry and report on significant themes. The purpose of this paper is to develop a research-based framework for inquiry-based science exploration in preschool settings that cuts across specific interventions, science concepts, or activities to provide teachers with strategies to build and sustain a culture of inquiry that permeates all aspects of their preschool program. To create this framework, 15 studies were analyzed, and five major themes were uncovered regarding how teachers engaged students in inquiry. With students' curiosity, wonderings, and interests as an essential starting point, the framework outlines these five themes as teacher strategies to support scientific inquiry in preschool. These strategies, rather than implemented in isolation, blend together to assist teachers in transforming play and teacher-initiated or child-initiated activities into rigorous learning and support the creation of a culture of inquiry that is part of their classroom environment.

AB Purpose - The authors extend the recent research using the risk component of human resource's (HR's) compensation plans to examine the effects of risk components on two strategic outcomes: within-firm temporal change, or strategic variation, and firm strategic divergence from the industry, or strategic deviation. In addition, the authors examine the role of previous financial performance as a boundary moderator condition of the effects of risk components in the compensation plan and firm strategic outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach - To examine the effects of low- and high-risk components of executive compensation on strategic variation and deviation over time, the authors collected data from 2,510 companies listed in the Standard and Poor's 500 index in a panel data format of a 12-year period. The authors gathered financial and other firm-level data from COMPUSTAT, and executive compensation and executive-level data from ExecuComp.
   Findings - The findings support the main effects of risk components on strategic change, while both high- and low-risk components act on strategic deviation contingent on the moderating role of total shareholder return (TSR). In the theoretical framework, the authors test the moderating role of total shareholder return (TSR) as a boundary condition of the effects of risk components in the compensation plan. In doing so, the authors provide a fine-grained understanding of the influence of compensation plan risk components on outcomes proximal to executives, such as the maintenance of the status quo and the search for financial gains.
   Research limitations/implications - New studies can explore a three-way moderating effect on performance indicators, such as TSR, Tobin's Q and return on asset. The authors addressed this limitation and did a comparative analysis, but the authors did not include additional moderating mechanisms in these interactive effects.
   Practical implications - By disaggregating the executive's compensation based on the risk components, boards of directors can mitigate any possible unwanted biases in the relationship between principal and agent.
   Originality/value - By considering the influence of both low- and high-risk components of compensation plans on strategic outcomes -instead of firm performance - this study expands strategy literature supporting the influence of compensation schema on a firm's outcomes. This path is new because it offers a moderating perspective to understand the strategic deviations and changes that chief executive officers imprint in their firms.

AB This paper examines the effects of ownership structure on dividend policy, specifically the role of controlling shareholders in shaping dividend policy in a sample of firms that pay dividends and issue new equity simultaneously. The results show that managers in weakly governed firms are more likely to initiate customized dividends to meet outside large shareholders' needs while simultaneously using costly external capital to finance new investment projects. This paper contributes to the existing literature on agency problems by explaining why firms engage in this suboptimal dividend policy: it allows large shareholders to extract private benefits.

AB Low mate fidelity and return rates are common in many migratory bird species. These low rates are likely due to high mortality during migration, making it impossible for between-year mate reunion to occur. Historically, the majority of return rate studies focused on long-distance migrants. We chose to study Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis), a partially migratory and socially monogamous thrush, to better understand how variation in migration affects the evolution of breeding systems and mate choice. We monitored 59 pairs of Eastern Bluebirds across 4 breeding seasons to determine their return and reunion rates. We also examined the relationship between nest success and mate fidelity. Our data indicate that Eastern Bluebirds have high return and reunion rates. Many of the bluebirds that mated together in previous breeding seasons appear to not only reunite the next year, but they also return to the same territory and nesting cavity. Our results differ from previous findings on Eastern Bluebirds and stress the importance of replication in ecology and ornithology.

AB Tidal processes regulating sediment accretion rates and vegetated platform erosion in tidal systems strongly affect salt marsh evolution. A balance between erosion and deposition in a restored salt marsh is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to be adopted within a natural context. Marsh morphology is also coupled with tidal mudflats and channel networks and this makes micro-tidal systems crucial for a detailed assessment of restoration interventions. Here, we present a methodological approach for monitoring channel morphodynamics and vegetation variations over a time frame of six years in a low tidal energy salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.

AB Climate dictates the critical aspects of human environmental conditions. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions due to human-induced climate change have alarmingly increased. Consequently, climate change directly affects environmental sustainability and human mortality in the short term and creates prolonged and complicated long-term indirect grave risks. This paper examines three-level environmental impact risks associated with climate change on human mortality. It proposes a conceptual framework for developing an empirical event-based human mortality database related to climate change and communication strategies to enhance global environmental adaptation, resilience, and sustainability.

AB Purpose This study aimed to describe physical activity (PA) via the frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression (FITT-VP) principles of Native Americans (NA), it is necessary to understand their current PA. The purpose was to 1) evaluate PA levels utilizing FITT-VP principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women. Methods Recruitment and evaluation (n = 586) took place as part of the OPREVENT2 study baseline evaluation. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form assessed frequency (days per week), intensity (walking, moderate, vigorous), and time (minutes per day). The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d provided the volume of activity. Results The NA sample was 45.8 +/- 15.1 yr of age, with a body mass index of 31.5 +/- 6.4 kg center dot m(-2). The FIT-V corresponded to 4.7 +/- 2.3 d center dot wk(-1), walking (3.3 METs intensity), 52 +/- 47 min center dot d(-1), and 2536 +/- 2203 MET center dot min(-1). The men (n = 162) reported a greater frequency of 3.2 +/- 2.5 d center dot wk(-1) (P = 0.007) of vigorous activity lasting 55 +/- 50 min center dot d(-1) compared with the women (n = 433) with 2.6 +/- 2.5 d center dot wk(-1) of vigorous activity lasting 34 +/- 38 min center dot d(-1). The men reported higher MET-minutes than did the women (P = 0.0001). Overall, 71% of men and 77% of women met the recommended PA guidelines. Conclusions Given that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.

AB Salt marsh evolution is strongly affected by tidal processes and ecology, which regulate sediment accretion and erosional rates. A balance between marsh erosion and deposition in a restored tidal wetland is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to adopt in a natural context. Here, we present an integrated approach monitoring salt marsh seasonal changes over several months in a microtidal restored salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (MD, USA). The project is undertaken at a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is being used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. We flew an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an RGB and a multispectral camera to obtain a high-resolution map of the planimetric position of vegetation and to monitor the health of the marsh vegetation in diverse seasons. Due to its extension of 400 m by 400 m, a total of four flight plans were necessary to cover the entire marsh flying at a 40 m altitude obtaining a 2 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD). This technique provides reliable results at a very low cost, enabling an accurate assessment of the marsh platforms to be conducted over time, due to both the very high spatial resolution and the precise georeferencing of the images for the comparisons. Our results show seasonal variability in the two dominant species colonizing the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora, and high marsh, Sporobolus pumilus. While the lower marshes showed a higher variability along seasons, the up-land vegetation showed persistent green foliage during cold seasons. Detecting salt marsh evolution and seasonality coupled with field measurements can help to improve the accuracy of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. Understanding the drivers of salt marsh evolution is vital for informing restoration practices and designs, in order to improve coastal resilience, and develop and coastal management strategies.

A purposive sample of (N = 291) Vietnamese high school and college students found that they have positive stereotypes about Americans in general and a mix of positive and negative stereotypes about Black/African-Americans. Of the three theoretical models, the communication model had collectively the strongest predictors, followed by the psychological model, and then the contact model. Theoretical as well as practical implications of the study is discussed.

AB Although voting is a fundamental mechanism through which Americans engage with their democracy, social workers often do not see it as a valid component of practice. Voting is an important source of political power and provides a means to ensure equitable representation. Educating social work students on how they can encourage voter engagement within practice is an important step to rectifying this missed opportunity. This article describes the implementation of a voter engagement model in social work education. Pre- and post-tests from 475 participants demonstrate the efficacy of this model in increasing social work students' perceived importance of voting to their practice, their likelihood of voting in future elections, and their likelihood of engaging others in voting in future elections.

AB Drawing on expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature, we examine the effects of team members' actual expertise and social status on the degree of influence they exert over team processes via perceived expertise. We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.

AB The purpose of this study was threefold: to expand the existing leader error taxonomy to include a third dimension of leader error (i.e., ethical errors), to examine the differential effects of error type on leader ratings, and to test a mediated model in which behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between error type and leader ratings. Results showed that ethical errors were distinct from previously established dimensions. Ethical and relationship errors resulted in lower ratings of leader liking and willingness to follow the leader, as compared to task errors. In addition to showing how error types differentially affected leader ratings, this study provided evidence for how this relationship is transmitted. Across two mediation models, behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between leader error and leader ratings after an error occurred. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed as well as future directions for research.

AB Concepts regarding effects of recurrent natural disturbances and subsequent responses of communities are central to ecology and conservation biology. Tropical cyclones constitute major disturbances producing direct effects (damage, mortality) in many coastal communities worldwide. Subsequent reassembly involves changes in composition and abundance for which the underlying mechanisms (deterministic and stochastic processes) are still not clear, especially for mobile organisms. We examined tropical cyclone-induced changes in composition and reassembly of entire insect communities in 16 Louisiana coastal salt marshes before and after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 and 2013. We used the Shannon index and multivariate permutational ANOVA to study insect resistance and resilience, beta diversity partitioning to evaluate the importance of species replacement, and null models to disentangle the relative roles of different assembly processes over time after the tropical cyclone. The alpha diversity and species composition, overall and for different trophic levels, decreased immediately after the tropical cyclone; nonetheless, both then increased rapidly and returned to pre-cyclone states within one year. Changes in species abundance, rather than species replacement, was the primary driver, accounting for most temporal dissimilarity among insect communities. Stochastic processes, which drove community composition immediately after the tropical cyclone, decreased in importance over time. Our study indicates that rapid reformation of insect communities involved sequential landscape-level dynamics. Cyclone-resistant life cycle stages apparently survived in some, perhaps random locations within the overall salt marsh landscape. Subsequently, stochastic patterns of immigration of mobile life cycle stages resulted in rapid reformation of local communities. Post-cyclone direct regeneration of salt marsh insect communities resulted from low resistance, coupled with high landscape-level resilience via re-immigration. Our study suggests that the extent of direct regeneration of local salt marsh insect communities might change with the size of larger marsh landscapes within which they are imbedded.

AB Female bird song has been underappreciated and understudied, especially in temperate species. Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.

AB This article studies the influence of enterprise core competence on IT application maturity (ITAM) from the perspectives of management institutional and process management capabilities. The roles of firm ownership and international organization of standard (ISO) certifications are also studied. Based on reliable and valid measurements of IT applications maturity, management institutional capability, and process management capability, the authors collect corresponding data from 123 companies in China. They find a positive relationship between capabilities and ITAM. Management institutional capability has a stronger relationship with ITAM in Chinese state-owned enterprises or public companies; while multinational companies or joint ventures witness a stronger relationship with process management capability. ISO helps companies with low management institutional capability to improve ITAM. However, for companies with higher management institutional capability, ISO mitigates the relationship and poses a shift of the importance to process management capability in improving ITAM.

AB Social media platforms represent a potentially cost-effective solution to obtaining stated preference data. We use data from a representative sample and a sample of convenience to investigate how willingness to pay (WTP) for increased cultural (recreational) use of an ecologically unique site differs across the two groups. We find mixed evidence of differences in WTP estimates between the two samples depending on the survey attribute. Where differences exist, the most effective selection correction mechanism is the ordered probit with weights. Our results suggest caution about extrapolating results to the general population from samples of conveniences without correcting for sample selection.

AB As human activity increases in primate habitats, it is critical to understand people's perceptions of primates and of potential conflicts with them. We investigated the perceptions of crab-eating bearded capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) in two communities with different sources of revenue in Northeast Brazil. Parnaiba relies heavily on crab-catching, whereas Preguicas relies mostly on tourism. We conducted questionnaires (N = 421) and compared the responses of residents from the two communities and those of tourists in Preguicas. We also conducted interviews (N = 21) with residents of Preguicas to examine the influences of tourism, landscape change, and overlapping resource use on people's perceptions of capuchins. All residents reported seeing capuchins often, but residents in Preguicas reported liking them relatively more than residents of Parnaiba, where fewer respondents described capuchins as damaging property. Residents did not report conflict with the capuchins at either site. Tourists in Preguicas also did not observe human-capuchin conflicts. Although most residents knew that the capuchins were legally protected and believed that they had adequate food in the mangroves, some people reported feeding them at both sites. Tourists, who knew less about the capuchins and their habitat than did residents, were aware that providing food was illegal but were uncertain of the capuchins' protected status. Interviews confirmed that residents were very knowledgeable about capuchin ecology and changes in habituation and habitat use, given increased tourism, decreased hunting, and environmental change. Our results suggest that resource and spatial overlap does not necessarily result in perceived conflict, supporting previous ethnoprimatological work, and highlight areas where tourism and conservation initiatives may support a nonconflictive (harmonious) and sustainable, multispecies coexistence.

TI Characterization of an L-Ascorbate Catabolic Pathway with Unprecedented
   Enzymatic Transformations
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English

ID DEHYDROASCORBIC ACID; DEGRADATION; HYDROLYSIS
AB L-Ascorbate (vitamin C) is ubiquitous in both our diet and the environment. Here we report that Ralstonia eutropha H16 (Cupriavidus necator ATCC 17699) uses L-ascorbate as sole carbon source via a novel catabolic pathway. RNaseq identified eight candidate catabolic genes, sequence similarity networks, and genome neighborhood networks guided predictions for function of the encoded proteins, and the predictions were confirmed by in vitro assays and in vivo growth phenotypes of gene deletion mutants. L-Ascorbate, a lactone, is oxidized and ring-opened by enzymes in the cytochrome b(561) and gluconolactonase families, respectively, to form 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate. A protein predicted to have a VVD40-like fold catalyzes an unprecedented benzilic acid rearrangement involving migration of a carboxylate group to form 2-carboxy-L-Iyxonolactone; the lactone is hydrolyzed by a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily to yield 2-carboxy-L-Iyxonate. A member of the PdxA family of oxidative decarboxylases catalyzes a novel decarboxylation that uses NAD(+) catalytically. The product, L-lyxonate, is catabolized to alpha-ketoglutarate by a previously characterized pathway. The pathway is found in hundreds of bacteria, including the pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.

TI LAX-Score: Quantifying Team Performance in Lacrosse and Exploring IMU

DE Wearable Sensing; Machine Learning; Athletic Performance Enhancement
AB For the past several decades, machine learning has played an important role in sports science with regard to player performance and result prediction. However, it is still challenging to quantify team-level game performance because there is no strong ground truth. Thus, a team cannot receive feedback in a standardized way. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we designed a metric called LAX-Score to quantify a collegiate lacrosse team's athletic performance. Next, we explored the relationship between our proposed metric and practice sensing features for performance enhancement. To derive the metric, we utilized feature selection and weighted regression. Then, the proposed metric was statistically validated on over 700 games from the last three seasons of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse. We also explored our biometric sensing dataset obtained from a collegiate team's athletes over the course of a season. We then identified the practice features that are most correlated with high-performance games. Our results indicate that LAX-Score provides insight into athletic performance beyond wins and losses. Moreover, though COVID-19 has stalled implementation, the collegiate team studied applied our feature outcomes to their practices, and the initial results look promising with regard to better performance.

AB In this study, we partition the joint provision of nonaudit services (NAS) into audit-related, tax, and all other services, and examine whether these services have varying impacts on independence-in-appearance, as measured by earnings response coefficients, over an extended period following the enactment of SOX. Prior research examining independence-in-appearance generally focuses on the years surrounding SOX and uses an aggregate NAS measure despite anecdotal and experimental evidence that there may be heterogeneity in how investors perceive different types of NAS. We first show, consistent with prior research, that an aggregate measure of NAS does not, on average, significantly influence earnings response coefficients. We then partition NAS fees by type and provide evidence that investors have negative perceptions of audit-related NAS and positive perceptions of tax NAS, and that these two effects cancel out one another in aggregate. Further investigation reveals that our results are driven by firms with high levels of accruals and smaller firms, which further corroborates our findings. We also find that measures of financial dependence fail to fully capture the channels through which NAS influences investor perceptions. Lastly, we provide evidence that perceptions of tax NAS are, in part, driven by their effect on a firm's tax strategies.

AB Evidence suggests that mangroves protect economic activity in coastal areas. We estimate this protection from mangroves and coastal elevation globally, examining both "direct" and "indirect" exposure events (<100 km vs.<greater than or equal to>100 km distance from a cyclone's "eye", respectively). We find that higher elevation (>= 50 m) or wide mangroves (>= 10 m seaward width) alone shelter economic activity from indirect cyclone exposure, whereas protection from direct cyclone exposure occurs only in high elevation communities with wide mangroves. Our results reveal that the majority of these "safe havens" are in upper middle-income countries but provide significant benefits to populations in lower middle-income countries.

AB As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, health researchers and practitioners have focused attention on identifying the factors that may help to shape health-protective behaviors, protecting individual health and well-being, and helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study explores the potential role of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) as key cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors. Using multiple theoretical frameworks (social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model), this paper develops and tests a hypothesized serial mediation model in which PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors including hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. Results suggest that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the positive relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors. These results yield valuable insights regarding the usefulness of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors and for possible self-leadership and PsyCap interventions, potentially tailored to at-risk populations, which should have practical benefits for both the current and future pandemics and health crises.

AB Weakly familiar brands are likely disadvantaged compared to well-known brands in influencing consumers' prepurchase quality perceptions. In this research we find that an unfamiliar brand can successfully use an Exceptionally Strong Warranty (ESW) as a quality signal under some conditions. When used in an offer alone, ESW results in more favorable perceptions of quality than a weaker market-standard warranty provided consumers' self-assessed knowledge for the product concerned is high enough, and regardless of their objective product knowledge. However, ESW is not an effective quality signal for consumers with low levels of self-assessed product knowledge unless it is accompanied by a supporting trusted signal like Third-Party Organization Endorsement (TPOE). It appears that consumers with high self-assessed knowledge tend to accept an ESW from an unfamiliar brand heuristically whereas the signal needs assistance from a naturally trusted signal like TPOE to be effective for low knowledge consumers also.

AB Previous work has shown a misalignment between the goals of faculty and students for laboratory coursework. Although faculty often list learning techniques and developing critical thinking skills as goals for laboratory, students tend to focus on affective goals, such as finishing lab early and obtaining good grades. The goals of faculty have been thoroughly investigated through both qualitative and large-scale quantitative studies. However, studies on student goals for laboratory coursework have primarily been conducted using qualitative methods. In order to provide a more comprehensive idea of students' goals in the laboratory, we have designed a brief, online survey. The survey was used to investigate students' goals in the laboratory and build on existing literature by including survey questions that catalog how students plan on achieving their goals. In this study, we discuss results about students' goals and achievement strategies at the beginning of the semester and after completing the laboratory portion of the course. Anonymous responses, via the online survey, were collected from undergraduate students enrolled in chemistry courses at two Midwestern universities. These results are intended to inform the discussion among faculty regarding how to change laboratory coursework and the instruction to better align faculty and student goals.

AB Juvenile summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and southern flounder P. lethostigma inhabit turbid salt marsh estuaries. Predation rates by juveniles (50-90 mm) were examined at 5 daytime light levels (6 x 10(11) to 2 x 10(14) quanta s(-1) cm(-2)) and in darkness and 4 turbidity levels (clear [<= 1], 11, 20, and 40 NTU) at an intermediate light level. Both species fed equally well on benthopelagic mysid shrimp and benthic spionid polychaetes at all daytime light levels tested. However, predation on mysids was significantly reduced in the dark. Consumption of polychaetes was not reduced in the dark by either species, illustrating the effectiveness of non-visual foraging methods on benthic prey. Turbidity levels tested did not affect predation on either prey type by either flounder species. Locomotor behavior was examined at the same turbidity levels. P. lethostigma spent more time swimming in the water column than P. dentatus in lower turbidity (clear-20 NTU), and both species reduced swimming at 40 NTU. It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style for P. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species. Turbidity can thus alter foraging modes and types of prey consumed, affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base supporting these young fishes.

AB Using air travel ticketing data for the travel dates around the 2015 Super Bowl in Phoenix, AZ, we exploit the exogenous shock created by the National Football Leagure conference championship round results and design a quasi-natural experiment to identify market-specific airfare and booking patterns. Our findings help quantify the impact on the resolution in uncertainty by measuring the changes in airfare and bookings, before and after the conference championship games, in the airline markets of finalist teams and teams that lost in the conference championship round. This empirical evidence provides important insights to airlines.

AB Growth rate of Fundulus heteroclitus was examined at 25 and 30 degrees C in nine treatments of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Extreme diel-cycling DO (1-11 mg O2.L-1) negatively impacted growth during 10 days at 30 degrees C, but not at 25 degrees C. Moderate DO cycles (3-9 mg O2.L-1) had no direct growth impact at either temperature. Fish did not appear to acclimate, during days 10-30, to the initial growth-limiting effects of extreme diel DO cycles at 30 degrees C. Diel-cycling DO interacts synergistically with temperature to impact growth. There was no evidence of an independent growth effect of either moderate pH cycles (7.2-7.8) or extreme pH cycles (6.8-8.1) at either temperature. Mean low pCO(2) levels in extreme cycles were similar to 32 000 and similar to 47 000 mu atm at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. It is noteworthy that these high mean nightly pCO(2) levels are more than an order of magnitude higher than the chronic mean oceanic pCO(2) of similar to 1000 mu atm projected by the year 2100.

ID MANAGEMENT; HABITAT; FIRE
AB The frosted elfin (Callophrys irus Godart) is a globally rare butterfly that inhabits disturbance-dependent habitats often managed by prescribed fire. Natural history observations and published data are equivocal on whether frosted elfin caterpillars pupate below or above the soil surface, and some evidence suggests that pupation sites differ for caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus spp.) versus wild indigo (Baptisia spp.). Pupation site has important implications for management because pupae located beneath the soil surface will likely be afforded greater protection from fire than those above the soil surface. Our study of both lupine- and indigo-feeding larvae at a single site in Worcester County, Maryland, found that pupation occurs above the soil surface in the leaf litter 92% of the time, and does not differ significantly with food plant preference. We recommend that land managers using prescribed fire as a habitat management tool for frosted elfin habitat assume some level of pupal mortality in burned areas and utilize a rotational burn schedule that maintains areas of unburned refugia in high-density elfin areas. We also recommend that managers try to establish a metapopulation structure for frosted elfin to address the possibility of natural occurring fires.

AB Perceived job insecurity is a critical job stressor that creates the conditions for negative health and performance outcomes for workers while potentially increasing health-related costs for employers. Sleep quality, an important proxy of health, has been understudied in relation to the impact of perceived job insecurity. Using job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, this study examines the association between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality while considering negative work spillover as a mediator. We expand our analysis to consider gender as a moderator of the job insecurity-sleep quality relationship, predicting the relationship will be stronger for men than for women. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample from the Midlife Development in the United States National Survey Refresher study consisting of 1031 working adults and a multi-group path analysis to test our hypotheses. Results show that negative work spillover mediates the relationship between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality. Study 2 uses a sample of 152 working adults who participated in three biweekly surveys. The mediating role of negative work spillover is replicated in Study 2. In both studies, no gender moderation is found. Theoretical and methodological contributions, limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of autoregulated and non-autoregulated applied pressures during blood flow restriction resistance exercise to volitional fatigue on indices of arterial stiffness using the Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System. Following a randomized autoregulated or non-autoregulated blood flow restriction familiarization session, 20 physically active adults (23 +/- 5 years; 7 females) participated in three randomized treatment-order sessions with autoregulated and non-autoregulated and no blood flow restriction training. Participants performed four sets of dumbbell wall squats to failure using 20% of one repetition maximum. Blood flow restriction was performed with 60% of supine limb occlusion pressure. Testing before and post-session included an ultrasonic scan of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, and blood pressure acquisition.
   Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity increased in the non-autoregulated and no blood flow restriction training groups following exercise while carotid-radial pulse wave velocity increased in the no blood flow restriction training group (all p<0.05). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity exhibited an interaction effect between autoregulated and non-autoregulated blood flow restriction in favor of autoregulated blood flow restriction (p<0.05). Autoregulated blood flow restriction training does not influence indices of arterial stiffness while non-autoregulated and no blood flow restriction training increases central stiffness.

AB Given the ongoing debate on the relationship between institutions and entrepreneurship, this study aims to better understand the joint effects of two country-level formal institutions, government effectiveness and political freedom, and whether the informal institution of religiosity moderates this relationship. To achieve this goal, the current study used multiple datasets, including the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), World Governance Indicators (WGIs), and the WIN-Gallup International Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism. The data cover 85 countries from 2010 to 2017. The results suggest that the rate of entrepreneurial activity across nations is shaped by the interplay between formal and informal institutions.

TI Borders: An International Comparative Analysis of Social Work's Response
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK

DT Article
DE borders; policy practice; social justice; social work education
AB Borders play a profound role in human life. In many settings, land borders are highly permeable and provide little barrier to movement, communication and interaction. In other circumstances, borders are highly rigid, difficult to cross and can demarcate vast economic and social disparities. The widely differing circumstances related to border creation and maintenance have deep effects that are worthy of social work attention and engagement. There has been serious attention to issues of globalisation, immigration and human rights in the social work literature. Our focus on borders is related to, but distinct from these issues, and therefore, has something unique to offer. Increased globalisation has led to a major reconceptualisation in our understanding of borders. The COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates the limited relevance of borders in some circumstances (spreading of the virus) but the heightened relevance of borders in other circumstances (travel restrictions). Social work practitioners have a role in framing the understanding of borders and resulting policies. Our focus is to address the question: How has social work engaged with border issues? We examine three international cases and conduct a comparative analysis to examine similarities and differences. From the analysis, we draw conclusions to further understanding for social work.
   Borders play a profound role in human life. This paper aims to examine how social work has engaged with borders. Conducting a comparative analysis of three international borders we describe impacts on practice and the profession. Noting similarities and differences we also assert generalisable conclusions and welcome engagement to further refine the analysis. Never before has it felt so timely to reflect on the issue of borders. The places that we come from have all been sharply affected by having land borders with neighbouring countries. At the time of writing, the contours of division that have marked our territorial separateness have come to the fore with COVID-19 restrictions impacting the movements of populations. Against this backdrop, social work has at its core an international definition and attendant global identity. Historically less clear is social work's position and stance adopted in dealing with borders. This paper is our attempt to bring attention to salient issues. First, by way of context, this topic will be examined within the context of key messages from literature.

AB Background/Objective: In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that acute lower leg heating (LLH) increases postheating popliteal artery blood flow and 6-minute walk distance in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods: Six patients (5 male, 1 female) with PAD (69 +/- 6.9 years; claudication: ankle-brachial index < 0.90) participated in 3 randomized treatment sessions (2-7 days apart): control or bilateral LLH conducted via water bath immersion (42 degrees C; similar to 40-cm depth) for either 15 or 45 minutes. Popliteal artery blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and arterial pressure weremeasured before and after LLH. Six-minute walk distance was measured on the control day and each experimental day 35 minutes post-LLH. Results: Popliteal artery blood flow increased after heating in a duration-dependent manner (P < .05, postheating vs control for both heating conditions and between them). Six-minute walk distance increased by 10% and 12% after 15-and 45-minute heating treatments, respectively (P < .05 vs control session). Conclusions: Lower leg heating, for as short as 15 minutes, increases postheating leg perfusion and exercise capacity in patients with PAD.

AB Purpose The business sector plays a major role in achieving comprehensive economic development goals in emerging economies. Consequently, the effects of business responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are receiving increasing research attention from an organizational management development perspective. This article aims to examine the role of leadership in charting the course in an extraordinary crisis context. Design/methodology/approach Using institutional leadership theory, leadership contingency theory and dynamic leadership capability theory, the authors present a research framework that defines macrochallenges and organizational level responses and outcomes. The article adopts a case study approach, which includes the identification of four target companies and conducting in-depth interviews with senior management professionals within those companies at different time periods. Findings Based on the interviews, the steps that Indian companies adopted to respond to the COVID-19 challenge are identified. Expanding the insight from the case study, the findings suggest that although feeling overwhelmed at first, organizational leaders combine prudent (i.e. timely and speedy actions for survival first) and bold (i.e. future envisioning for expansion and growth) actions enabling these firms to weather two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Originality/value These multiple case studies are unique in exploring MNEs from different industries. This study also highlights the dynamic relationships between leadership practices, risk management strategies and performance outcomes based on a sound theoretical model and rigorous study methods.

AB Online reviews have diffused into a large variety of businesses, ranging from physical goods to services. The ubiquity of the reviews and the importance given to them by potential customers makes examining their validity extremely important. While good reviews can boost companies' business, bad reviews can spell their doom. Since online reviews are anonymous, there are cases of both false advertising and slander that can create conflict. In this paper authors provide reasons for online rating bias and demonstrate a way to measure it. Authors mine consumer's location aware tweets from business locations to capture a location's pleasure score and compare the pleasure scores to Yelp ratings to determine how overrated or underrated the venue is. Foursquare and Twitter are mined to extract an emotion score from the location aware tweets using a dictionary called the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW). Rating biases are found across cities and different types of restaurants and managerial and policy implications discussed.

AB This study evaluates the influence of resilience as a potential coping strategy to help reduce student departure from the accounting major. We collected data from 443 accounting majors at four geographically disbursed U.S. universities using a battery of psychometric instruments. With these data, we analyzed the relations between role stressors, psychological health, burnout, and departure intentions, and assessed the extent to which individual resilience levels served as a positive influence by enhancing health, and diminishing burnout and departure intentions. We found sources of role stress to have significant negative associations with psychological health, and significant positive associations with academic burnout (direct), and departure intentions (indirect). However, resilience counteracted those associations through its direct positive association with psychological health, and direct negative association with burnout. Resilience also had a significant indirect negative association with departure intentions through its direct associations with psychological health (positive) and burnout (negative).

AB Two-sided B2B electronic markets involve a market-maker platform firm that coordinates transactions between the buyer and seller sides of the online marketplace. This paper examines certain formal (monitoring) and informal (procedural fairness) governance processes that platform firms can leverage to manage platform participants. We hypothesize the impact of these processes on sellers' performance vis-a-vis the platform's buyers. We also incorporate the platform firm's structural attributes (self-participation and investments) as moderators of the relationship between platform governance and seller performance. We find that both monitoring and procedural fairness increase seller performance individually. However, the two moderators present opposite interaction patterns: self-participation promotes the performance properties of fairness, but undermines that of monitoring, while investments exhibit an exactly opposite effect. For platform managers, our findings suggest two "choice-packages" comprising different process-structure constellations for enhancing the performance of platform participants.

AB In this study we consider corporate political contributions as a special type of social capital reserved for future contingencies. Firms benefit from making such contributions when the government suddenly intervenes in the market. We explore this value-creation mechanism in terms of the firm-investor relationship, not in terms of the traditional firm-government relationship. When a government intervention is being proposed or approved, firms that have made political contributions coordinating with political candidates are likely to enjoy better stock market returns than those that have not made such contributions. We also argue that firms that have made political contributions may experience lower stock returns than those that have not when the intervention plan is rejected. By focusing on the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008, our event study analysis with three news announcements finds that financial institutions that made political action committee (PAC) contributions indeed enjoyed higher stock returns when TARP was proposed and eventually approved. However, we do not find support for the investors' devaluation of political contributions when TARP was once rejected during the review process. The findings propose that managers can use corporate political contributions as a strategic option to help investors reduce investment uncertainty by presenting their readiness for any unexpected change in the regulatory environment.

AB We study the effect of stakeholder orientation on corporate tax avoidance. Using the staggered passage of constituency statutes across U.S. states between 1983 and 2006, we show that greater stakeholder orientation results in increased tax avoidance. We further find greater tax avoidance among firms with limited financial resources and that employees benefit from the change. Our results are consistent with stakeholder salience theory that resource-constrained managers prioritize the claims of salient stakeholders, such as employees, at the expense of secondary stakeholders, such as the government.

AB This paper explores the connections between education for youth civic engagement and theories and strategies from public health (specifically, epidemiology). We illustrate this with four applications of epidemiologic theory to youth civic engagement: social determinants and fundamental causes, vulnerable populations and cumulative disadvantage, positive spillover, and herd immunity and critical mass. Formalizing concepts of current civics, in schools and the public, as a civic epidemic, we present a case for individual- and group-level interventions based around targeted, school-based, effective civic education initiatives. Grounded in epidemiological theory, such approaches call attention to the simultaneous need to improve broad civics education and ensure that particular populations receive necessary attentions.

AB Discussions about increasing diversity in economics have ignored the role that associations play in the engagement of underrepresented economists. We continue work on diversity and inclusion in the Northeastern Agriculture and Resource Economics Association (NAREA) and other associations by analyzing membership and meeting attendance to promote diversity in economics. We estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) to identify the determinants of membership and meeting attendance and use member survey data to model membership and meeting attendance behavior. We find inequalities across gender, income, and professional status. Recommendations include locating meetings in accessible cities, increasing networking opportunities, and providing more services supporting underrepresented groups.

AB We propose a notion of Frobenius-Perron dimension for certain free Z-modules of infinite rank and compute it for the Z-modules of finite dimensional complex representations of unitary groups with nonnegative dominant weights. The definition of Frobenius-Perron dimension that we are introducing naturally generalizes the well-known Frobenius-Perron dimension on the category of finite dimensional complex representations of a finite group.

AB The food-burying behavior has been reported in many mammals and birds, but was rarely observed in invertebrates. The red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is an invasive pest in many areas of the world that usually performing food-burying during the foraging processes. However, the impacted factors and measureable patterns of this behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, food-burying vs food-transport behaviors of Solenopsis invicta were observed under laboratory and field conditions. When starved (no food was provided for 37 days) in the laboratory, food (sausage) was consumed by large numbers of ants, and few burying behaviors were observed. However, when food was provided until satiation of the colonies, food-transport was suppressed and significantly more soil particles were relocated on the food and graph paper square (where the food was placed) when compared with these colonies exposed to starved conditions. Videotapes showed that soil particles (1.47 +/- 0.09 mm(2)) were preferentially placed adjacent to (in contact with) the food items at the beginning; and after the edges were covered, ants transported significantly smaller soil particles (1.13 +/- 0.06 mm(2)) to cover the food. Meanwhile, larger particles (1.96 +/- 0.08 mm(2)) were pulled/dragged around (but not in contact with) the food. Interestingly, only a small number of ants, mainly the small workers, were involved in food-burying, and the ants tended to repeatedly transport soil particles. A total of 12 patterns of particle transport were identified, and soil particles were most frequently picked from the foraging arena and subsequently placed adjacent to the food. In the field, almost all released food was actively transported by Solenopsis invicta workers, and no burying behavior was observed. Our results show that the food-burying behavior of Solenopsis invicta may be associated with the suppressed foraging activity, and the burying task may be carried out by certain groups of workers.

AB Phytoplankton biomass is routinely estimated using relationships between cell volume and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content that have been defined using diverse plankton that span orders of magnitude in size. Notably, volume has traditionally been estimated with geometric approximations of cell shape using cell dimensions from planar two-dimensional (2D) images, which requires assumptions about the third, depth dimension. Given advances in image processing, we examined how cell volumes determined from three-dimensional (3D), confocal images affected established relationships between phytoplankton cell volume and C and N content. Additionally, we determined that growth conditions could result in 30-40% variation in cellular N and C. 3D phytoplankton cell volume measurements were on average 15% greater than the geometric approximations from 2D images. Volume method variation was minimal compared to both intraspecific variation in volumes (similar to 30%) and the 50-fold variation in elemental density among species. Consequently, C:vol and N:vol relationships were unaltered by volume measurement method and growth environment. Recent advances in instrumentation, including those for at sea and autonomous applications can be used to estimate plankton biomass directly. Going forward, we recommend instrumentation that permits species identification alongside size and shape characteristics for plankton biomass estimates.

AB Disorders of the nervous system (NS) impact millions of adults, worldwide, as a consequence of traumatic injury, genetic illness, or chronic health conditions. Contemporary studies have begun to incorporate neuroglia into emerging NS therapies to harness the regenerative potential of glial-mediated synapses in the brain and spinal cord. However, the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds neuroglia and interfaces with their associated synapses remains only partially explored. The flow of CSF within subarachnoid spaces (SAS) circulates essential polypeptides, metabolites, and growth factors that directly impact neural response and recovery via signaling with healthy glia. Despite the availability of artificial CSF solutions used in neurosurgery and NS treatments, tissue engineering projects continue to use cell culture media, such as Neurobasal (NB) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), for development and characterization of many transplantable cells, matrixes, and integrated cellular systems. The current study examined in vitro behaviors of glial Schwann cells (ShC) and spinal cord explants (SCE) within a CSF replacement solution, Elliott's B Solution (EBS), used widely in the treatment of NS disorders. Our tests used EBS to create defined chemical microenvironments of extracellular factors within a glial line (gLL) microfluidic device, previously described by our group. The gLL is comparable in scale to the in vivo SAS that envelopes endogenous CSF and enables molecular transport via mechanisms of convective diffusion. Our results illustrate that EBS solutions facilitate ShC survival, morphology, and proliferation similar to those measured in traditional DMEM, and additionally support glial chemotactic behaviors in response to brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). Our data indicates that ShC undergo significant chemotaxis toward high and low concentration gradients of BDNF with statistical differences between gradients formed within diluents of EBS and DMEM solutions. Moreover, SCE cultured with EBS solutions facilitated measurement of neurite explant extension commensurate with reported in vivo measurements. This data highlights the translational significance and advantages of incorporating CSF replacement fluids to interrogate cellular behaviors and advance regenerative NS therapies.

AB Females of many species choose mates using multiple sensory modalities. Multimodal noise may arise, however, in dense aggregations of animals communicating via multiple sensory modalities. Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female tungara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication. Our results demonstrate that multimodal signals have the potential to increase the complexity of the sensory scene and reduce the efficacy of female decision making.
   Animal courtship signals are complex. Males of many species advertise their availability as a mate using a complex suite of acoustic, visual, olfactory, or other signals. In tungara frogs, females assess potential mates using both acoustic and visual signals of courting males. In some conditions, the visual cue of a male's inflatable vocal sac can improve the ability of a female to discriminate among different male advertisement calls. When the mating scene becomes noisy, however, a female's ability to choose among the advertisement calls may be compromised. Here we demonstrate how visual and acoustic noise can interfere with female mate choice decisions.

AB Eusocial insects have evolved diverse particle-use behaviors. A previous study reported that red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, deposited soil particles on substances treated with essential balm, a fire ant repellent. We hypothesized that S. invicta modifies inaccessible surfaces by covering them with soil particles to facilitate food search and transportation. Here, laboratory experiments were conducted to study the particle-covering behavior of S. invicta in response to viscose surfaces or surfaces treated with essential balm or liquid paraffin in the presence of real food (sausage) or non-food objects (acrylic plates). S. invicta workers deposited significantly more soil particles on these three types of treated surfaces than on untreated surfaces. In addition, significantly more particles were relocated on viscose and paraffin-smeared surfaces in the presence of food than in the presence of non-food objects. The particle-covering behavior on viscose surfaces was also observed in the field. Interestingly, when no soil particles were available, ants searched and transported food on viscose surfaces only if the surfaces were artificially covered with sufficient quantities of soil particles but could not do so on viscose surfaces without soil particles or with insufficient quantities of soil particles. In addition, ants actively relocated particles to cover viscose surfaces if the transportation distance was within 200 mm, whereas significantly fewer particles were relocated at longer transportation distances (400 mm). Our study provides a novel example of particle use by fire ants during foraging.

AB Property O, introduced by Galkin et al. for arbitrary complex, Fano manifolds X, is a statement about the eigenvalues of the linear operator obtained by the quantum multiplication by the anticanonical class of X. We prove that property O holds in the case when X= IG (k,2n+1) is an odd symplectic Grassmannian. The proof uses the combinatorics of the recently found quantum Chevalley formula for IG (k,2n+1), together with the Perron-Frobenius theory of nonnegative matrices.

AB For primitive nontrivial Dirichlet characters chi(1) and chi(2), we study the weight zero newform Eisenstein series E-chi 1, (chi 2) (z, s) at s = 1. The holomorphic part of this function has a transformation rule that we express in finite terms as a generalized Dedekind sum. This gives rise to the explicit construction (in finite terms) of elements of H-1(Gamma(0)(N),C). We also give a short proof of the reciprocity formula for this Dedekind sum.

ID CAREERS
AB Amid increasing demands from students and the public, universities have recently reinvigorated their efforts to increase the number of faculty from underrepresented populations. Although a myriad of piecemeal programs targeting individual recruitment and development have been piloted at several institutions, overall growth in faculty diversity remains almost negligible and highly localized. To bring about genuine change, we hypothesize a consortia approach that links individuals to hiring opportunities within a state university system might be more effective. Here we present a case study describing the progress of the NSF-funded Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) PROMISE Academy Alliance, a consortium within the University System of Maryland (USM) collaborating to develop, implement, self-study, evaluate, and disseminate a unique postdoc-to-faculty conversion model in the biomedical sciences. The initiative centers on diversifying faculty across five institutions in the USM, including teaching-focused institutions, comprehensive universities, research institutions, and professional schools. Components of this approach include (1) enhanced recruiting and hiring practices to attract outstanding postdoctoral scholars from underrepresented backgrounds, (2) multi-institutional networking and professional development, and (3) facilitated processes to transition (or "convert") postdocs into tenure-track positions at their postdoctoral institution or another institution in the state system. This model is distinct from more deficit-based approaches because it goes beyond focusing on building the individual's skills to enter the professoriate. This program restructures the traditionally short-term nature of postdoctoral employment and incorporates a pathway to a tenure-track professorship at the same institution or within the same statewide system where the postdoc is trained. This multi-institutional model leverages collaboration and distinct institutional strengths to create cross-institutional support, advocacy, and policy. Importantly, it uses a decentralized financial structure that makes this approach distinctly replicable. Recognizing the immediate need for more collaborative approaches to diversify faculty and a lack of literature about such approaches, this case study describes the development of, and potential benefits of, a state university system, as well as the qualitative lessons learned from self-study, internal evaluation, external evaluation, and NSF site visits. The AGEP PROMISE Academy can serve as a model for replication at other university systems hoping to diversify their faculty.

AB Partnering has enabled state departments of transportation (DOTs) and aviation construction projects to significantly reduce claims and improve project schedules. Today there is a wide body of empirical evidence that demonstrates partnering benefits outweigh the resources devoted to its implementation. Despite such outstanding outcomes, collaborative partnering is still new, misunderstood, underutilized, and evolving for airport construction projects that entail greater complexity and increased risks due to a high number of stakeholders and additional sector-specific regulations. The objectives of this study are to describe the state-of-practice regarding partnering in the aviation construction industry and offer insights about its use. A comprehensive survey of industry professionals representing DOTs, airports, and others involved in construction aviation projects in the United States helps capture partnering trends across the industry. Findings show that participants with experience in partnered-aviation construction projects perceive higher improvement of safety and reduced claims offering greater rewards. However, these projects are operating as late adopters of partnering with many at the initial stages of implementation. The main contribution of the paper to the body of knowledge is that partnering is suitable for airport projects regardless of the project delivery method followed, budget size, or partnering intensity levels. Those with greater experience with partnering under design-bid-build project delivery methods are more likely to perceive higher improvements. Furthermore, it increases trust and strengthens the relationships between organizations. The findings are significant as they bring attention to team integration practices for improved outcomes via the underutilized partnering in an industry niche where stakeholder and risk management are key to project success.

AB BACKGROUND The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, is a significant urban, agricultural, and medical pest with a wide distribution in the world. Surface or mound treatment using contact insecticide is one of the main methods to control S. invicta. In the present study, cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, was evaluated for S. invicta control and compared with two referent insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin. RESULTS Surfaces or sand treated with cycloxaprid, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin caused high mortality of S. invicta workers, and the action of cycloxaprid or imidacloprid was slower than bifenthrin. Like imidacloprid and bifenthrin, cycloxaprid can be horizontally transferred from corpses or live donor ants to recipient ants. In addition, cycloxaprid- or imidacloprid-treated surfaces significantly induced the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and detoxification enzymes; nevertheless, they had no significant effect on the foraging behaviors of S. invicta workers. Also, sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid did not negatively affect the digging activities of ants. Interestingly, S. invicta workers excavated significantly more sand containing 0.01 mg/kg cycloxaprid than untreated sand in the no-choice digging bioassays. In addition, extensive nesting activities (sand excavation and stacking) were observed in the flowerpots containing untreated sand or sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid. On the contrary, bifenthrin significantly reduced the foraging, digging, and nesting activities of S. invicta workers. CONCLUSION Cycloxaprid is a slow-acting and nonrepellent insecticide against S. invicta workers, and its contact and horizontal toxicities are slightly higher than imidacloprid.

AB Not all instructors implement active-learning strategies in a way that maximizes student outcomes. One potential explanation for variation in active-learning effectiveness is variation in the teaching knowledge an instructor draws upon. Guided by theoretical frameworks of pedagogical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, this study investigated the teaching knowledge instructors used in planning, implementing, and reflecting on active-learning lessons in large courses. We used a preinstruction interview, video footage of a target class session, and a postinstruction interview with stimulated recall to elicit the teaching knowledge participants used. We then conducted qualitative content analysis to describe and contrast teaching knowledge employed by instructors implementing active learning that required students to generate their own understandings (i.e., generative instruction) and active learning largely focused on activity and recall (i.e., active instruction). Participants engaging in generative instruction exhibited teaching knowledge distinct from that of participants focused on activity. Those using generative instruction drew on pedagogical knowledge to design lessons focused on students generating reasoning; integrated pedagogical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge to plan lessons to target student difficulties; and created opportunities to develop new pedagogical content knowledge while teaching. This work generated hypotheses about the teaching knowledge necessary for effective, generative active-learning instruction.

AB Tropical deforestation has typically been characterized as a process with persistent environmental costs (in the form of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss) and short-lived economic benefits (in the form of one-off timber harvests and agricultural fertility boosts). However, this characterization is largely based on agronomic study of tropical soils, and does not fully capture the long-term agricultural potential of cleared land. Landowners can make investments to improve fertility and raise productivity, extending the time horizons over which agriculture is profitable. Whether they choose to make these investments depends on available technologies, the relative prices of inputs and outputs, and the cost of the alternative strategy of clearing additional forest. There is little evidence on how agricultural productivity in the tropics changes over time for individual farmers, because regional development processes confound changes in land productivity when aggregate data are used. Understanding the trajectory of returns to land after tropical deforestation matters because the effectiveness of policies to limit deforestation, promote reforestation, and encourage agricultural intensification all depend on the values of forested and deforested land to farmers and the time horizons over which those values are maintained. This paper estimates the contributions of forested, newly-deforested, and long-deforested land to total property values reported by smallholders in established agrarian settlements in the western Brazilian Amazon. We find-during a decade in which the Brazilian government significantly strengthened its enforcement of forest laws-that deforested land retained its value, the value of forested land increased relative to cleared land, and the value of newly cleared land declined.

AB To increase efficiency in the search for resources, many animals rely on their spatial abilities. Specifically, primates have been reported to use mostly topological and rarely Euclidean maps when navigating in large-scale space. Here, we aimed to investigate if the navigation of wild common marmosets inhabiting a semiarid environment is consistent with a topological representation and how environmental factors affect navigation. We collected 497 h of direct behavioral and GPS information on a group of marmosets using a 2-min instantaneous focal animal sampling technique. We found that our study group reused not only long-route segments (mean of 1007 m) but entire daily routes, a pattern that is not commonly seen in primates. The most frequently reused route segments were the ones closer to feeding sites, distant to resting sites, and in areas sparse in tree vegetation. We also identified a total of 56 clustered direction change points indicating that the group modified their direction of travel. These changes in direction were influenced by their close proximity to resting and feeding sites. Despite our small sample size, the obtained results are important and consistent with the contention that common marmosets navigate using a topological map that seems to benefit these animals in response to the exploitation of clustered exudate trees. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the Caatinga landscape imposes physical restrictions in our group's navigation such as gaps in vegetation, small trees and xerophytic plants. This study, based on preliminary evidence, raises the question of whether navigation patterns are an intrinsic characteristic of a species or are ecologically dependent and change according to the environment.

AB Simple Summary Adhesive tapes are as effective as baits and pitfall traps in monitoring Solenopsis invicta and Tapinoma melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China. However, adhesive tapes detected less ants and fewer species of non-target ants than baits and pitfall traps. Our study demonstrated that tape-paving behavior can potentially be used in developing more specific monitoring methods for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China. Our previous study discovered that two urban pest ants, red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and ghost ants, Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius) (Formicidae: Dolichoderinae), can pave viscose surfaces with particles to facilitate food search and transport. We hypothesize that this paving behavior can be applied to monitor S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. In the present study, 3998 adhesive tapes, each with a food source (sausage), were placed in 20 locations around Guangzhou, China (181-224 tapes per location), and their efficiency to detect S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was compared with two traditional ant-monitoring methods, baiting and pitfall trapping. Overall, S. invicta was detected by 45.6% and 46.4% of baits and adhesive tapes, respectively. In each location, the percentage of adhesive tapes detecting S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was similar when compared to baits and pitfall traps. However, significantly more non-target ant species showed up on bait and pitfall traps. Seven non-target ant species-Pheidole parva Mayr (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole nodus Smith (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole sinica Wu & Wang (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole yeensis Forel (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Carebara affinis (Jerdon) (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Camponotus nicobarensis Mayr (Formicidae: Formicinae), and Odontoponera transversa (Smith) (Formicidae: Ponerinae)-also showed tape paving behavior, but they can be easily distinguished morphologically from S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. Our study showed that the paving behavior occurs in different subfamilies of ants (i.e., myrmicinae, dolichoderinae, formicinae, and ponerinae). In addition, paving behavior can potentially be used to develop more specific monitoring methods for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China.

TI Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories Version 2.0: A Revised
   and Updated Manual for 2019
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The original Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories were developed in 2012 in response to an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that originated from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. In the 7 years since the publication of the guidelines, there have been two subsequent CDC-reported Salmonella outbreaks originating from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Use of and issues with the guidelines by ASM members have been tracked by various means since publication, and in 2018 it became apparent that an update of the guidelines was necessary. The Education Board of the American Society for Microbiology charged this task force with updating the guidelines based on the accumulated information. While the guidelines should look familiar, users will find that the originally separate BSL1 and BSL2 guidelines have been rolled into one document, to help eliminate redundancy and confusion. In addition, sections on risk assessment and service animals in the teaching laboratory have been added. These updated guidelines should help clarify many of the issues for which users expressed problems with the original guidelines.

AB Through a behavioral study, we investigate buyers' strategic order forecasting behavior in a multi-period setting under a forecast accuracy-based allocation policy, where the supplier allocates (proportionally) more inventory to the buyer with the better order forecast accuracy in case of scarce supply. We developed an interactive game that simulates a supply chain in which one supplier sells a key component to two buyers, who in turn sell to consumers. In each period, buyers share forecasts of future orders with their supplier. The participants in the game play the role of a buyer, while the supplier is automated. Our experimental findings suggest that rewarding forecast accuracy in allocating inventory can significantly improve the order forecast accuracy of the buyers and reduce their forecast inflation behavior. Interestingly, even without communication of the policy, buyers learn over time that more accurate forecasts lead to better service from their supplier and improve their order forecast accuracy.

AB Castration-resistant prostate cancer can be treated with the antiandrogen enzalutamide, but responses and duration of response arc variable. To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified 11 genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1) whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in CA-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro. Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival, and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, although PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival. Our study has therefore identified at least three new supporters of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.

AB Recent disruptions, labor shortages, and fiscal pressures, especially in retail service environments, have necessitated and highlighted changes in the roles and responsibilities of frontline employees, often requiring them to enforce mask mandates and police customer deviant behavior (CDB). While extant work has investigated the impact of policing, or guardianship, for customers and firms, there has been limited examination regarding the policies themselves and the corresponding toll exacted upon frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). Thus, this phenomenon warranted an in-depth, multi-method investigation, including a full-scale qualitative exploration substantiated and extended via three experiments and a survey. The qualitative approach probes employees' feelings about and identifies categories of CDB in retail service settings as well as develops a novel typology of guardianship policies (policy type x approach style). The subsequent studies empirically test the CDB guardianship typology in the context of a particularly detrimental type of CDB-shoplifting, while advancing understanding of firm-related (guardianship expectations), employee-related (trait anxiety) and job role-related (FLE vs FLM) contextual factors impacting perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions. The findings provide rich insights for practitioners and scholars by offering a novel guardianship typology and an extensive agenda for future research.

AB Although algebra often functions as a gatekeeper to higher-level mathematics courses and higher education admissions, few quality measures exist for assessing conceptual understanding. This study explored the technical adequacy of three procedural and two conceptual algebra screening measures. We administered three rounds of assessments throughout an algebra course to 2,021 secondary students of 31 teachers in three states. Assessments included procedural and conceptual screening measures and additional criterion measures: teacher ratings of students' algebra proficiency, course grades, results of two project-specific algebra proficiency exams, and state test scores. Descriptive and correlation analyses were used to investigate measure scores, alternate-form and test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Procedural measure results indicated high levels of reliability (r = .72-.99), and moderate concurrent and predictive validity (r = .36-.64; .36-.58). The conceptual measures produced moderate to low levels of validity (r = .10-.44). The procedural measure results suggest they may be suitable for use as screening measures, pending further revision and diagnostic testing, while the conceptual measures did not produce acceptable results for current implementation. The findings contributed to measure redesigns to bolster their use as mathematics proficiency assessments with algebra students.

TI The Capacious Model and Leader Identity: An Integrative Framework
SO JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL IDENTITY; SELF; CONSTRUCTION; STORIES; ECOLOGY
AB The Integrated Capacious Model of Leadership Identities Construction (ICM) is a framework for understanding leader identity that integrates four extant leader identity theories with the systems and influences in the Capacious Model of leader identity. The ICM's systems (Individual System, Microsystem, Mesosystem, Exosystem, Macrosystem, and Chronosystem) contextualize leader identity in time and space; its influences (Purpose/Calling, Self-Identity, Social Identity, and Relationships) pinpoint select factors that affect the construction of leader identities; and its integrated theories (Narrative Identity, Identity Theory, Social Identity Theory, and Social Constructionism) address the leader identity construction process. The ICM speaks to calls for interdisciplinary, multi-level frameworks that are situated within the stream of scholarly literature on leader identity, as the model presents leader identity as a construct located across space, time, and people, rather than the purview of a heroic leader or single instance of identity claiming. Connecting established identity theories, systems, and influences results in a descriptive, practical model of leader identity. Examples are provided of the practical utility of using the ICM as a diagnostic tool for constructing a leader identity, designing leader development programs, and identifying gaps in leader identity scholarship.

AB This meta-analysis found that the emotional intelligence-organizational citizenship behavior relationship is stronger in long-term oriented and restraint cultures. However, this relationship does not differ between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, masculine and feminine cultures, high uncertainty avoidance and low uncertainty avoidance cultures, and high power distance and low power distance cultures. The emotional intelligence-counterproductive work behavior relationship is stronger in collectivistic, feminine, high uncertainty avoidance, high power distance, long-term oriented, and restraint cultures. Emotional intelligence-organizational citizenship behavior/counterproductive work behavior relationships are mediated by both state positive affect and state negative affect. Human resource development professionals from cultures where the effects of emotional intelligence are stronger are especially recommended to hire emotionally intelligent employees and/or provide emotional intelligence training to stimulate organizational citizenship behavior and to restrain counterproductive work behavior. Although there are important cross-cultural differences, emotional intelligence universally encourages organizational citizenship behavior and almost universally diminishes counterproductive work behavior across cultures.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are important policy instruments for forest conservation, but it is unclear if improved management can increase PA effectiveness. In Brazil, formal management plans are required to be in place shortly after the creation of a PA. This requirement is rarely enforced and, as a result, several PAs undergo many years without approved plans. We take advantage of this variation among PAs to study the impact of management plans on deforestation. We provide estimates from two quasi-experimental evaluation approaches based on the generalization of the difference-in-differences estimator: (1) matching-based methods for time-series crosssectional data analysis and (2) the generalized synthetic control (GSC) method. We find weak, yet generally consistent, evidence across these two methods suggesting that PAs with approved management plans protect forests more effectively over time. Significant impact estimates from the matching-based approach ranged more widely than the GSC method (0.01%-0.09% versus 0.04%-0.05% of avoided deforestation per year, respectively). The effect size of these impacts is relatively substantial given that the average annual forest loss from our PA sample was 0.07% (+/- 0.40%). To the extent that PAs with approved management plans reflect actual differences in PA management quality, our findings suggest that investments in improving PA management could result in positive conservation gains over time.

AB Animals frequently experience changes in their environment, including diel and seasonal shifts in abiotic and biotic factors. In addition to physiological and morphological changes, animals alter their behavior in response to environmental variation. This study examined the impacts of heterogeneous environments on mating behaviors. We examined both male and female tungara frog phonotactic responses to multimodal (audiovisual) and unimodal (acoustic) stimuli. We altered aspects of the physical environment by changing substrate (terrestrial and aquatic) and ambient light levels. Females demonstrated a similar preference for the audiovisual stimulus regardless of substrate but decreased latency to choose in an aquatic environment. When ambient light levels were increased (relative to darker control), females reversed their preference, avoiding the multimodal stimulus, but the latency to choose was unchanged. Males demonstrated no preference for the multimodal signal on either substrate, but like females, male latency was reduced in an aquatic environment. Different environments carry their own associated costs, including varying levels of predation risk. Increased light levels and an aquatic environment likely carry higher predation risk and therefore should lead to changes in female and male responses. Interestingly, these two environments do not cause uniform changes in female responses. The addition of an aquatic environment led to a reduction in latency, whereas an increase in ambient light levels induced a change in female mate preference. These findings demonstrate the importance of the environment on mating responses to multimodal signals.Significance statementResponses to conspecific mating signals (e.g., mate preferences) have often been assumed to be static. In this study, we tested responses of both male and female tungara frogs to a multimodal (visual + vocal) advertisement signal under varying environmental conditions. Elevated light levels changed female responses to mating signals. When both sexes were required to swim, rather than walk to a signal, their choices did not change. They did respond faster, however. These results indicate that measuring the strength of sexual selection should be considered as a function of both innate preferences and the environmental conditions experienced by the animals.

AB China experienced an unprecedented increase in labor strikes until the mid-2010s, and the country continues to experience considerable strike activity. Therefore, it is important to study what predicts Chinese workers' attitudes toward strikes. The study applies social exchange theory as an overarching framework to investigate the contributions of three forms of social exchange relations in organizations-employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations-to account for Chinese employees' attitudes toward strikes in multinational corporations (MNCs) based in China. Using a matched employee-employer sample of more than 1,600 employees in 41 China-based MNCs, the results obtained from hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis show that individual-perceived employee-employer relations indicated by a negative reciprocity norm is positively related to employees' strike attitudes. Labor-management relations indicated by the organizational-level cooperative industrial relations (IR) climate is negatively related to employees' strike attitudes. Leader-member relations indicated by leader-member exchange (LMX) is not significantly related to employees' strike attitudes. Overall, the results indicate that at the individual level, it is more important for companies not to do bad (to engage in negative reciprocity with workers) than to do good to reduce employees' strike attitudes.

AB Choosing a mate is one of the most important decisions an animal can make. The fitness consequences of mate choice have been analysed extensively, and its mechanistic bases have provided insights into how animals make such decisions. Less attention has been given to higher-level cognitive processes. The assumption that animals choose mates predictably and rationally is an important assumption in both ultimate and proximate analyses of mate choice. It is becoming clear, however, that irrational decisions and unpredictable nonlinearities often characterize mate choice. Here we review studies in which cognitive analyses seem to play an important role in the following contexts: auditory grouping; Weber's law; competitive decoys; multimodal communication; and, perceptual rescue. The sum of these studies suggest that mate choice decisions are more complex than they might seem and suggest some caution in making assumptions about evolutionary processes and simplistic mechanisms of mate choice.

AB As species change through evolutionary time, the neurological and morphological structures that underlie behavioral systems typically remain coordinated. This is especially important for communication systems, in which these structures must remain coordinated both within and between senders and receivers for successful information transfer. The acoustic communication of anurans ("frogs") offers an excellent system to ask when and how such coordination is maintained, and to allow researchers to dissociate allometric effects from independent correlated evolution. Anurans constitute one of the most speciose groups of vocalizing vertebrates, and females typically rely on vocalizations to localize males for reproduction. Here, we compile and compare data on various aspects of auditory morphology, hearing sensitivity, and call-dominant frequency across 81 species of anurans. We find robust, phylogenetically independent scaling effects of body size for all features measured. Furthermore, after accounting for body size, we find preliminary evidence that morphological evolution beyond allometry can correlate with hearing sensitivity and dominant frequency. These data provide foundational results regarding constraints imposed by body size on communication systems and motivate further data collection and analysis using comparative approaches across the numerous anuran species.

AB With limited groundwater reserves and few reservoirs, Caribbean islands such as Puerto Rico are largely dependent on regular rainfall to meet societal and ecological water needs. Thus, the ability to anticipate seasonal rainfall shortages, such as the 2015 drought, is particularly important, yet few reliable tools exist for this purpose. Consequently, interpolated surface precipitation observations from the Daymet archive are summarized on daily, annual, and seasonal time scales and compared to the host thermodynamic environment as characterized by the Galvez-Davison index (GDI), a convective potential parameter designed specifically for the tropics. Complementing the Daymet precipitation totals, >= 1.1 million WSR-88D volume scans between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed for echo tops >= 10 000 ft (similar to 3 km) to establish a radar-inferred precipitation activity database for Puerto Rico. The 15-yr record reveals that the GDI outperforms several midlatitude-centric thermodynamic indices, explaining roughly 25% of daily 3-km echo top (ET) activity during each of Puerto Rico's primary seasons. In contrast, neither mean-layer CAPE, the K index, nor total totals explain more than 11% during any season. When aggregated to the seasonal level, the GDI strongly relates to 3-km ET (R-2 = 0.65) and Daymet precipitation totals (R-2 = 0.82) during the early rainfall season (ERS; April-July), with correlations weaker outside of this period. The 4-month ERS explains 51% (41%) of the variability to Puerto Rico's annual rainfall during exceptionally wet (dry) years. These findings are valuable for climate downscaling studies predicting Puerto Rico's hydroclimate in future atmospheric states, and they could potentially be adapted for operational seasonal precipitation forecasting.

AB Ectropisgrisescens Warren (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is one of the most severe defoliating pests of tea plants. Synthetic pesticides have been widely applied to control this pest in tea plantations, but pesticide residues may decrease the quality and safety of tea products. In the present study, we hypothesized that soil treatment with the two commercial biopesticides (Shuiguxin (R)) based on Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) could reduce the survivorship and fitness of E. grisescens. Wandering larvae of E. grisescens were allowed to pupate in soil treated with each biopesticide, and the concentrations of M. anisopliae (Shuiguxin (R)) and B. bassiana (Shuiguxin (R)) that produced the 50% mortality values (LC50) were 2.9 x 10(6) and 1.6 x 10(7) conidia/g soil, respectively. Artificial burying the pupae using soil treated with M. anisopliae (Shuiguxin (R)) and B. bassiana (Shuiguxin (R)) (1 x 10(8) or 1 x 10(9) conidia/g soil for both biopesticides) also significantly reduced emergence success of E. grisescens. In addition, choice tests showed that soil treated with the high concentration of M. anisopliae (Shuiguxin (R)) or B. bassiana (Shuiguxin (R)) had repellent effects on pupating E. grisescens. However, sublethal concentrations (LC25 and LC50) of both biopesticides did not significantly affect fecundity, fertility and longevity of post-emerged adults. Our study showed that soil treatment with the two commercial biopesticides caused direct mortality of pupating E. grisescens, but may not effectively suppress E. grisescens populations at sublethal concentrations. The realistic application of the fungal dosage in fields should be determined in future studies

AB Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality, resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caught tungara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. We first identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement and water ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between two courtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combined cross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in the presence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. These results highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers to improve performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.

AB While the impact of negative customer treatment on service employees and their organizations is often emphasized in both scholarship and the popular press, relatively little work has examined the effects of customer courtesy. We draw on the social cognitive theory to theorize that customer courtesy can enhance service performance via its positive effect on employee self-efficacy. Although getting customers to display courtesy may be outside an organization's direct control, we reason that management can amplify these benefits by establishing a strong organizational support climate. To examine our predictions, we developed a customer courtesy scale, then deployed it among service employees in the United States (Study 1) and hotel employees and their supervisors in East Asia (Study 2). We also collected experimental data (Study 3) to test our causal model. Across our studies, our data support the benefits of customer courtesy on employee self-efficacy and, by extension, employee service performance. Moreover, our data reveal that when organizational support climate increases, the effect of customer courtesy on self-efficacy and thus, service performance increases. Although it may be the case that bad is sometimes stronger than good, our work highlights the importance of positive workplace interactions (e.g., customer courtesy) on valued employee outcomes.

AB The Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) requires the preservation and restoration of forests in riparian preservation areas (RPAs). The total area in RPAs and the impacts of changes in the BFC on RPA requirements are uncertain due to lack of clarity about how RPAs are defined in practice. We reconstruct the history of the RPA rule, use a recent cadastral database (CAR) of the state of Rondonia to quantify the area of RPA by stream size and to document the impact of the 2012 changes in RPA requirements, and review the literature on hydrological ecosystem services (HES) in light of RPA rules. We find that most (64%) of the area in RPAs in the state of Rondonia was illegally deforested by 2017, and the 2012 regulations require restoration of only half of that cleared area. Most of the RPA is located along small streams (< 10 m wide) that were typically missing in previous assessments. As of 2017, 66% of the RPA along small streams was deforested, while most (70-95%) RPA along large streams (> 200 m wide) was forested. Current restoration requirements (5 m regardless of stream width) for very small properties (< 60 ha) are likely inadequate to restore HES. Preservation of forest along large streams remains important, but policy and management should also emphasize the preservation and restoration of forest along small streams because they account for most of the riparian preservation area, with important implications for humans and ecosystems.

AB Matching the supply of medical equipment with soaring demand caused by an epidemic event is a daunting challenge. Focusing on medical equipment manufacturers, this study empirically examines how supply chain management impacts manufacturers' responses to epidemic-driven demand. This study employs novel supply chain data from South Korea collected before and after the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic event. In the results, we show that such an epidemic positively influences the sales performance of medical equipment manufacturers (i.e. a 10.2 percentage-point increase). To identify the mechanism behind this result, we provide evidence that increasing the supply base (i.e. the number of supply channels) enables medical equipment manufacturers to better respond to epidemic-driven demand and ultimately improves their sales performance. More interestingly, we find that medical equipment manufacturers with lower market status (i.e. lower market shares and lower supplier shares) expand their supply bases more extensively than other medical equipment manufacturers with higher market status do. Interpreting these results, we offer managerial insights into how medical equipment manufacturers can effectively manage their supply chains and improve their performance when responding to epidemic-driven demand.

AB Noise is a common problem in animal communication. We know little, however, about how animals communicate in the presence of noise using multimodal signals. Multimodal signals are hypothesised to be favoured by evolution because they increase the efficacy of detection and discrimination in noisy environments. We tested the hypothesis that female tungara frogs' responses to attractive male advertisement calls are improved in noise when a visual signal component is added to the available choices. We tested this at two levels of decision complexity (two and three choices). In a two-choice test, the presence of noise did not reduce female preferences for attractive calls. The visual component of a calling male, associated with an unattractive call, also did not reduce preference for attractive calls in the absence of noise. In the presence of noise, however, females were more likely to choose an unattractive call coupled with the visual component. In three-choice tests, the presence of noise alone reduced female responses to attractive calls and this was not strongly affected by the presence or absence of visual components. The responses in these experiments fail to support the multimodal signal efficacy hypothesis. Instead, the data suggest that audio-visual perception and cognitive processing, related to mate choice decisions, are dependent on the complexity of the sensory scene.

AB Mangroves shelter coastlines during hazardous storm events with coastal communities experiencing mangrove deforestation are increasingly vulnerable to economic damages resulting from cyclones. To date, the benefits of mangroves in terms of protecting coastal areas have been estimated only through individual case studies of specific regions or countries. Using spatially referenced data and statistical methods, we track from 2000 to 2012 the impact of cyclones on economic activity in coastal regions inhabited by nearly 2,000 tropical and subtropical communities across 23 major mangrove-holding countries. We use nighttime luminosity to represent temporal trends in coastal economic activity and find that direct cyclone exposure typically results in permanent loss of 5.4-6.7 mo for a community with an average mangrove extent (6.3 m per meter of coastline); whereas, a community with more extensive mangroves (25.6 m per meter of coastline) experiences a loss equivalent to 2.6-5.5 mo. These results suggest that mangrove restoration efforts for protective benefits may be more cost effective, and mangrove deforestation more damaging, than previously thought.

AB Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is a dominant shrub in the warm deserts of North America and also a classic example of an autopolyploid complex. We determined ploidy levels for creosote leaves preserved in ancient packrat middens from the Peloncillo Mountains, AZ to better understand the history of ploidy race distribution along its diploid-tetraploid boundary. We also measured modem creosote ploidy level at several sites spanning the AZ-NM border to augment sampling in this large geographic area. Modem plants were mostly diploids, with tetraploids only observed in our northernmost sites. Ancient creosote from the Peloncillo middens (3170-145 cal yr BP) were all diploids. Modem creosote at the Peloncillo site is also diploid, but with significantly larger guard cells areas that may be a response to increasingly hot, dry conditions.
   The lack of tetraploids in the midden fossils suggests the arrival of tetraploids at their eastern margin may have occurred only recently, mirroring the late arrivals of other Sonoran Desert plants (e.g., Simmondsia chinensis) along the AZ-NM border.

DT Article; Data Paper
ID DECLINE; PERCH
AB HRBS-GLWNB 2020 presents the first open-source and high-resolution bathymetry, shoreline, and water level data for Lakes Victoria, Albert, Edward, and George in East Africa. For each Lake, these data have three primary products collected for this project. The bathymetric datasets were created from approximately 18 million acoustic soundings. Over 8,200 km of shorelines are delineated across the three lakes from high-resolution satellite systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles. Finally, these data are tied together by creating lake surface elevation models collected from GPS and altimeter measures. The data repository includes additional derived products, including surface areas, water volumes, shoreline lengths, lake elevation levels, and geodetic information. These data can be used to make allocation decisions regarding the freshwater resources within Africa, manage food resources on which many tens of millions of people rely, and help preserve the region's endemic biodiversity. Finally, as these data are tied to globally consistent geodetic models, they can be used in future global and regional climate change models.

AB We used compound-specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids (AAs) to determine the biosynthetic source of AAs in fish from major tributaries to California's Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta (i.e., the Sacramento, Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers). Using samples collected in winter and spring between 2016 and 2019, we confirmed that algae are a critical component of floodplain food webs in California's Central Valley. Results from bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in producers and consumers were adequate to characterize a general trophic structure and identify potential upstream and downstream migration into our study site by American shad Alosa sapidissima and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, respectively. However, owing to overlap and variability in source isotope compositions, our bulk data were unsuitable for conventional bulk isotope mixing models. Our results from compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of AAs clearly indicate that algae are important sources of organic matter to fish of conservation concern, such as Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in California's Central Valley. However, algae were not the exclusive source of energy to metazoan food webs. We also revealed that other sources of AAs, such as bacteria, fungi and higher plants, contributed to fish as well. While consistent with the well-supported notion that algae are critical to aquatic food webs, our results highlight the possibility that detrital subsidies might intermittently support metazoan food webs.

AB Past research has demonstrated that consumers' price fairness judgments are influenced by comparisons between the offer price they receive and the prices paid by other consumers for the same product offering. In today's digital age, reference points for purchases are more prevalent than ever. However, investigations on how certain inputs of the transaction affect these judgments is lacking. Specifically, extant research has failed to account for how the purchase efforts of other consumers can influence one's own price fairness evaluations. Moreover, relatively little empirical research has endeavored to understand the simultaneous cognitive and affective processes that explain how consumers arrive at price fairness judgments. To address these gaps in the literature, we introduce two studies aimed at understanding the process through which the salient efforts of referent consumers serve to mitigate perceptions of price unfairness when two customers pay different prices for the same product. The findings support a dual-process model whereby the efforts of other (referent) customers serve to simultaneously reduce buyer anger and increase buyer understanding of the price disparity, ultimately mitigating perceptions of price unfairness.

AB Historically and contemporarily marginalized youth who are disproportionately exposed to community violence are often the same youth who are less likely to be civically engaged. However, the community violence and civic engagement literatures have not yet fully explored how these experiences may be linked in young people's lives and in relation to what other forces. Using developmental assets and ecological-transactional frameworks, we review the emerging literature on civic engagement among youth exposed to community violence and how external developmental assets and neighborhood collective efficacy may create opportunity for their increased civic engagement. We present numerous conceptually- and empirically-based hypotheses to further examine the intersections between exposure to community violence and youth civic engagement. Ultimately, we identify opportunities for intervention.

AB This study explores the factor structure of job performance and each performance dimension's relative importance in determining supervisors' overall job performance ratings. We found that the optimal factor structure of job performance includes five dimensions: task performance, organizational citizenship behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (OCB-O and OCB-I, respectively), and counterproductive work behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (CWB-O and CWB-I, respectively). The percent-based relative weight (%RW) is the highest for task performance in determining job performance, followed by OCB and CWB. Interestingly, the %RW of non-task performance dimensions directed toward the organization (OCB-O and CWB-O) is similar to the %RW of task performance but greater than the %RW of non-task performance dimensions directed toward individuals (OCB-I and CWB-I).

AB BackgroundGuidelines allow for the omission of radiotherapy in older women with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, given that the patients receive adequate endocrine therapy (ET). However, the initiation of ET and survival outcomes after forgoing radiation therapy among these patients have not been well-studied. MethodsWe identified patients aged 70 to 90 years old newly diagnosed in 2010-2015 with early-stage, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/Her2-) breast cancer who received lumpectomy and omitted radiation therapy using the SEER-Medicare database. We examined the initiation of ET and the utilization patterns of ET using a multivariable logistic regression. We further examined the overall survival outcomes using Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting. ResultsOf the 2618 patients, 808 (30.9%) received no ET. The multivariable logistic regression showed that more recent years had better ET initiation (2013-2015 vs. 2010-2012: OR = 1.39, 95% CI:[1.16, 1.66]), while older patients (81-90 vs. 70-80: OR = 0.45, 95% CI:[0.38, 0.54]) were less likely to receive ET. Both the Kaplan-Meier estimation (log-rank p-value<0.0001) and the Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting (HR = 0.76, 95% CI:[0.58, 0.99]) showed that receiving ET was associated with better overall survival. ConclusionThis population-based study suggests that a sizable proportion of patients who omitted radiation did not receive endocrine therapy and receiving endocrine therapy was beneficial among these patients. Although ET initiation has improved in more recent years, certain patient groups were still especially susceptible to no endocrine therapy.

AB AIMThe aim of the study was to examine and describe student perceptions of severity of violations, faculty support, and support for program improvement strategies related to willingness to report peer violations.BACKGROUNDPeer reporting is important when students witness dishonest behaviors. To foster academic integrity, exploration of the willingness to report is needed.METHODUsing McCabe's Academic Integrity Survey-Modified for Nursing Students, 442 baccalaureate students were surveyed.RESULTSThe more students felt faculty supported related policies, the more willing students were to report (r(s) = .298, alpha = .05). The more students understood what was considered a violation, the more willing they were to report (r(s) = .485, alpha = .05). The more students believed program-wide strategies could prevent violations, the more willing they were to report (r(s) = .231, alpha = .05).CONCLUSIONEducation that helps define academic integrity can contribute to nursing students' willingness to report peer violations. Faculty support of policies and program-wide strategies contribute.

   ACCURACY; QUALITY
AB Background: Whole-body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been accepted as an indirect method to estimate appendicular lean mass (ALM) comparable to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, single or limited frequencies currently used for these estimates may over or under-estimate ALM. Accordingly, there is a need to measure the impedance parameter with appendicular lean-specific across multiple frequencies to more accurately estimate ALM. We aimed to validate muscle-specific frequency BIA equation for ALM using multifrequency BIA (MF-BIA) with DXA as the reference.
   Methods: 195 community-dwelling Korean older people (94 men and 101 women) aged 70 similar to 92y participated in this study. ALM was measured by DXA and bioimpedance measures at frequencies of 5 kHz similar to 3 MHz were assessed for independent predictive variables. Regression analyses were used to find limb-specific frequencies of bioimpedance, to develop the ALM equations and to conduct the internal cross-validation. The six published equations and the final equation of MF-BIA were externally cross-validated.
   Results: 195 participants completed the measurements of MF-BIA and DXA. Using bivariate regression analysis, the 2 MHz impedance index explained R-2 = 91.5% of variability (P < 0.001) in ALM and predictive accuracy of standard error of estimate (SEE) was 1.0822 kg ALM (P < 0.001). Multiple stepwise regression analysis obtained in the development group had an adjusted R-2 of 9.28% (P < 0.001) and a SEE of 0.97 kg ALM. The cross-validation group had no significant difference between the measured ALM and the predicted ALM (17.8 +/- 3.9 kg vs. 17.7 +/- 3.8 kg, P = .486) with 93.1% of R-2 (P < 0.001) and 1.00 kg ALM of total error. The final regression equation was as follows: ALM = 0.247ZI(@2 MHz) + 1.254SEX(M1F0) + 0.067Xc(@5 kHz) + 1.739 with 93% of R2 (P < 0.001), 0.97 kg ALM of SEE (Subjective Rating as "excellent" for men and "very good" for women). In the analysis of the diagnostic level for sarcopenia of the final regression, the overall agreement was 94.9% (k = 0.779, P < 0.001) with 71.4% of sensitivity, 98.8% of specificity, 91.3 of positive prediction value and 95.3% of negative prediction value.
   Conclusion: The newly developed appendicular lean-specific high-frequency BIA prediction equation has a high predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and agreement for both individual and group measurements. Thus, the high-frequency BIA prediction equation is suitable not only for epidemiological studies, but also for the diagnosis of sarcopenia in clinical settings.

AB Intestinal microbiota perform many functions for their host, but among the most important is their role in metabolism, especially the conversion of recalcitrant biomass that the host is unable to digest into bioavailable compounds. Most studies have focused on the assistance gut microbiota provide in the metabolism of carbohydrates, however, their role in host amino acid metabolism is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment on Mus musculus using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids (AA(ESS)) to quantify the community composition of gut microbiota and the contribution of carbohydrate carbon used by the gut microbiome to synthesize AA(ESS) that are assimilated by mice to build skeletal muscle tissue. The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes inversely varied as a function of dietary macromolecular content, with Firmicutes dominating when mice were fed low-protein diets that contained the highest proportions of simple carbohydrates (sucrose). Mixing models estimated that the microbial contribution of AA(ESS) to mouse muscle varied from less than 5% (threonine, lysine, and phenylalanine) to approximately 60% (valine) across diet treatments, with the Firmicute-dominated microbiome associated with the greatest contribution. Our results show that intestinal microbes can provide a significant source of the AA(ESS) their host uses to synthesize structural tissues. The role that gut microbiota play in the amino acid metabolism of animals that consume protein-deficient diets is likely a significant but under-recognized aspect of foraging ecology and physiology.

AB This study uses critical race theory (CRT) to uncover racialized interactions that influence legislative processes. The transcripts from public hearings from the 2017 Nevada State legislative session were included in the data analysis. Results demonstrate the utility of CRT as an analytic tool to examine the policy-making process, identify narratives that sustain and protect white supremacy imbedded in policies governing high school education, and uncover racist testimony throughout the policy-making process. More specifically, results demonstrate the ways that subtle racialized interactions drive conversations where White constituents protect white interests at the expense of racial equity. Conversely, findings highlight how People of Color issue a counternarrative by providing necessary historical context and perspectives to work toward racial justice goals.

AB The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the acute effect of vigorous physical activity on executive control in eighth grade students from the U.S. Participants were eighth grade students (N = 68; 26 girls, 42 boys) recruited from one middle school located in the Mountain West region of the U.S. Two groups of participants were assigned to receive either a vigorous physical activity or a sedentary condition within a counter-balanced cross-over design using a 2-week washout. Both groups were administered Trails Making Tests A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B) at 20- and 25-min post-treatment, respectively. Mixed design ANOVA tests with repeated measures examined differences between treatments on TMT-A and TMT-B performance and the modifying effect of sex. Students who completed the physical activity condition displayed a faster time to completion on the TMT-B compared to students who completed the sedentary condition (Mean difference = -6.5 s, p = 0.026, d = 0.42). There were no differences between treatment groups on TMT-A and no sex x treatment interactions (p > 0.05). This pilot study suggests that vigorous physical activity may improve executive control in middle-school students and adds to the existent literature that continues to examine the emerging link between physical activity and cognition in school-based settings.

AB Spatial memory allows animals to retain information regarding the location, distribution, and quality of feeding sites to optimize foraging decisions. Western gorillas inhabit a complex environment with spatiotemporal fluctuations of resource availability, prefer fruits when available, and travel long distances to reach them. Here, we examined movement patterns-such as linearity, distance, and speed of traveling-to assess whether gorillas optimize travel when reaching out-of-sight valued resources. Our results show that gorillas travel patterns are affected by the activity they perform next, the type of food they feed on, and their preference level to specific fruits, suggesting they are able to optimize foraging based on spatial knowledge of their resources. Additionally, gorillas left in the direction of the next resource as soon as they started traveling and decelerated before approaching food resources, as evidence that they have a representation of their exact locations. Moreover, home range familiarity did not influence gorillas' movement patterns, as travel linearity in the core and periphery did not differ, suggesting that they may not depend wholly on a network of paths to navigate their habitat. These results show some overlap with chimpanzees' spatial abilities. Differences between the two ape species exist, however, potentially reflecting more their differences in diet (degree of frugivory) rather than their cognitive abilities. Further studies should focus on determining whether gorillas are able to use shortcuts and/or approach the same goal from multiple directions to better identify the spatial abilities used by this species.

AB Sex-biased dispersal is common in many animals, with male-biased dispersal often found in studies of mammals and reptiles, including interpretations of spatial genetic structure, ostensibly as a result of male-male competition and a lack of male parental care. Few studies of sex-biased dispersal have been conducted in turtles, but a handful of studies, in saltwater turtles and in terrestrial turtles, have detected male-biased dispersal as expected. We tested for sex-biased dispersal in the endangered freshwater turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) by investigating fine-scale genetic spatial structure of males and females. We found significant spatial genetic structure in both sexes, but the patterns mimicked each other. Both males and females typically had higher than expected relatedness at distances < 25 km, and in many distance classes greater than 25 km, less than expected relatedness. Similar patterns were apparent whether we used only loci in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (n = 7) or also included loci with potential null alleles (n = 5). We conclude that, contrary to expectations, sex-biased dispersal is not occurring in this species, possibly related to the reverse sexual dimorphism in this species, with females having brighter colors. We did, however, detect significant spatial genetic structure in males and females, separate and combined, showing philopatry within a genetic patch size of C. guttata, which is concerning for an endangered species whose populations are often separated by distances greater than the genetic patch size.

AB El Yunque National Forest, situated in the Luquillo Mountains of northeast Puerto Rico, is home to a wide range of climate-sensitive ecosystems and forest types. In particular, these ecosystems are highly sensitive to changes in the hydroclimate, even on short time scales. Current global climate models (GCMs) predict coarse-scale reductions in precipitation across the Caribbean prompting the need to investigate future fine-scale hydroclimate variability in the Luquillo Mountains. This research downscales coarse-resolution GCM RCP8.5 predictions from the IPCC CMIP5 project to the local scale to better assess future rainfall variability during the most critical period of the annual hydroclimate cycle, the early rainfall season (ERS). An artificial neural network (ANN) is developed using five field variables (1000-, 850-, 700-, and 500-hPa specific humidity and 1000-700-hPa bulk wind shear) and four derived precipitation forecasting parameters from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. During the historical period (1985-2016), the ANN predicts a binary dry (<5 mm) versus wet (>= 5 mm) day outcome with 92% percent accuracy.
   When the historical inputs are replaced with bias-corrected data from four CMIP5 GCMs, the downscaled ensemble mean indicates a 7.2% increase in ERS dry-day frequency by mid-century (2041-2060), yielding an ERS dry-day percentage of 70% by mid-century. The results presented here show that the decrease in precipitation and wet-days is, at least in part, due to an increase in 1000-700-hPa bulk wind shear and a less favorable thermodynamic environment driven by increased mid-tropospheric warming and a stronger trade wind inversion. By regressing ERS total precipitation against dry-day frequency (R-2 = 0.95), the predicted mid-century dry-day proportion corresponds to a similar to 200-mm decrease in seasonal precipitation. In contrast, the ensemble predicts a dry-day frequency recovery back towards the historical climatological mean by end-century (2081-2100). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deforestation and global climate change are predicted to affect precipitation and agricultural productivity in the Amazon. Anecdotal evidence suggests that farmers are already being affected by changes in the timing and amount of precipitation, but there is little quantitative evidence on the mechanism by which precipitation affects production. This paper uses an innovative application of remote sensing and meteorological data to separate rainfall into green water (soil moisture that contributes to plant water use) and blue water (surface water), to estimate the impact of these water sources on the production and production efficiency of dairy in a mature colonization zone of the Brazilian Amazon. This approach allows us to draw inferences about different pathways through the precipitation-production causal chain and to link changes in precipitation with impacts on farm profits and welfare. We find that production and production efficiency are affected by green and blue water and that reductions in rainfall will have negative impacts that may disproportionally impact the poor. Our methods and results are informative to economists interested in this relatively new application of remote sensing data, to geographers interested in identifying the role of green and blue water in agricultural production, and more generally to researchers interested in the impacts of rainfall and water availability on small-scale producers in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB Individuals produce advertisement signals with intended purposes and targets. However, these signals can be received by eavesdroppers, who may extract information from them and alter their behavior according to the extracted information. In anuran systems, males congregate at breeding sites to produce advertisement calls to attract receptive females and fend off rival males. Both sexes directly assess these calls in dyadic encounters and make decisions based on the call's characteristics, e.g., frequency. What is unknown is whether bystander males eavesdrop on these same calls to inform their future competitive decisions. Here, we examined whether male green tree frogs (Hyla cinerea) eavesdrop on competing males, assess their competitor's call frequency, and respond accordingly. We exposed males to playbacks of two competing males that varied in call frequencyhigh, average, lowand quantified latency to call, time spent calling, and number of calling bouts. We found that males had reduced latency to call and called more when eavesdropping low-frequency competition, but not average or high-frequency competition. Focal male size also influenced how they responded, with larger males being more responsive than smaller males. Our results indicate that male green tree frogs are capable of eavesdropping on nearby male calls and produce behavioral responses accordingly. Further, it appears males are able to alternate between assessment strategies dependent upon the frequency of the eavesdropped competition. These findings indicate that males not only directly assess an opponent's call in dyadic encounters, but also indirectly through eavesdropping.Significance statementAnimals produce signals with intended purposes and targets, but which can be received by nearby eavesdroppers. Eavesdropped signals can elicit complex phenotypic changes in the eavesdropper, and lead to significant fitness consequences for the signal producer and eavesdropper. Thus, examining whether and to what extent individuals eavesdrop is an important step in understanding the evolution of signal production and response. Here, we examined whether male green tree frogs, H. cinerea, eavesdrop on nearby competing males and base their own calling behaviors on eavesdropped male's calling characteristics. Calling behavior was mediated by focal male body size and eavesdropped male's call frequency. Larger males reduced response latency and called more to nearby low-frequency males, while smaller males reduced response latency to nearby calls of average frequency. These results indicate that males will extract information from their competitive environment through eavesdropping and produce behavioral responses according to the eavesdropped information.

AB Some studies have found that dispersal rates and distances increase with density, indicating that density-dependent dispersal likely affects spatial genetic structure. In an 11-year mark-recapture study on a passerine, the dark-eyed junco, we tested whether density affected dispersal distance and/or fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of predispersal density on dispersal distance or the proportion of locally produced juveniles returning to the population from which they hatched. However, even though density did not affect dispersal distance or natal return rates, we found that density still did affect spatial genetic structure. We found significant positive spatial genetic structure at low densities of (postdispersal) adults but not at high densities. In years with high postdispersal (adult) densities that also had high predispersal (juvenile) densities in the previous year, we found negative spatial genetic structure, indicating high levels of dispersal. We found that density also affected fitness of recruits, and fitness of immigrants, potentially linking these population parameters with the spatial genetic structure detected. Immigrants and recruits rarely nested in low postdispersal density years. In contrast, in years with high postdispersal density, recruits were common and immigrants had equal success to local birds, so novel genotypes diluted the gene pool and effectively eliminated positive spatial genetic structure. In relation to fine-scale spatial genetic structure, fitness of immigrants and new recruits is poorly understood compared to dispersal movements, but we conclude that it can have implications for the spatial distribution of genotypes in populations.

AB Background: This study examined the trends and patterns of opioid and non-opioid pharmacotherapy use among a large national sample of privately insured pediatric patients with cancer in the United States. Materials and Methods: We identified pediatric (aged < 21) patients diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS), lymphoma, gonadal, leukemia, or bone cancer from MarketScan data 2005-2019. We examined the proportion of patients who filled a prescription for the following 5 types of pharmacotherapy: opioid, anticonvulsant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), antidepressant, and muscle relaxant during active cancer treatment. We assessed the trends and patterns in pharmacotherapy using multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among 4174 patients included, 2979 (71%) had an opioid prescription; 746 (18%), 384 (9%), 202 (5%), and 169 (4%) had anticonvulsant, NSAID, antidepressant and muscle relaxant prescriptions, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed a nonlinear trend in the use of opioids among pediatric patients with cancer over time such that use slightly increased until 2012 (OR of 1.40 [95% CI, 1.12-1.73] for 2012 vs. 2006) but then decreased thereafter (OR of 0.51 [0.37-0.68] for 2018 vs. 2012). The use of anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants increased significantly linearly over time (all P < .005). Conclusion: There has been a downward trend in the use of opioids in recent years among pediatric patients with cancer and an upward trend in the use of non-opioid pharmacotherapy for pain management potentially as an alternative to opioids.

AB In an increasingly competitive market economy, retailers are seeking ways to manage customer perceptions of their service quality. Selecting employees who are high on emotional intelligence (EI), and training employees in emotional competencies, may be ways to improve service quality. This meta-analysis tests the claims that EI improves service quality. The findings indicate that EI is significantly and positively related to service quality and that this relationship is stronger (1) for cultures that are short (versus long) term oriented and that are indulgent (versus restrained), and (2) for professional services and service shops than for mass services. The EI-service quality relationship does not differ between cultures that are masculine versus feminine and high versus low in uncertainty avoidance.

AB While nest usurpation and subsequent incubation of eggs and even brooding of chicks from other species has been reported for Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), such behavior is considered rare. We report an observation of a Common Tern pair usurping the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) nest and brooding the Least Tern chicks. While the Least Tern pair attempted to provide care for the chicks, the Common Terns displayed aggressive behavior and defended the nest. Though both species attempted to feed the chicks, no feeding events were observed due to harassment from the other species. Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation. We discuss the possible scenarios leading to the observed usurpation event, the possibility that usurpations are more common than previously believed, and the need for different monitoring methods to elucidate the causes of usurpations.

AB Animal traditions are increasingly threatened by human impact on natural habitats, posing a challenge to conservation policies. In northeastern Brazil, bearded capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus) inhabiting theCerrado-Caatingabiome of Fazenda Boa Vista use stone hammers and anvils to crack open palm nuts and other encased foods. The same species inhabiting the mangroves of Morro do Boi ambush crabs and process them using wooden hammers and anvils. These traditions are gradually acquired by young capuchins exposed to the tool using activity of skilled older group members. Changes in land cover have threatened the persistence of this species, where these rare tool-use traditions occur. To assess land cover changes over the past 30 years, we analyzed a time series of remotely sensed imagery and quantified trends in land cover and agriculture across both study sites. We also developed a predictive model to forecast future changes in land cover by 2034. Our results show that agriculture increased by more than 300% in both sites from 1987 to 2017. If current trends continue in Morro do Boi, only 42% of forest (0.15 km(2)) will remain, which is insufficient to support the resident population of capuchins. In Fazenda Boa Vista, most of the land suitable for agriculture has already been used for that purpose. If private conservation efforts at Fazenda Boa Vista are to be effective through 2034, agricultural use should not be expanded any further. Imminent erosion and loss of natural vegetation will exacerbate the current situation, even if agriculture is not expanded. Our study is an example of the need for conservation to take behavioral traditions into account, as they are not widespread across the species distribution.

AB Carbon metabolism provides organisms with energy and building blocks for cellular functions and growth. The tight regulation between degradation and assimilation of carbon substrates is central for optimal growth.
   Metabolic degeneracy describes the phenomenon that cells can use one substrate through different metabolic routes, while metabolic plasticity, refers to the ability of an organism to dynamically rewire its metabolism in response to changing physiological needs. A prime example for both phenomena is the dynamic switch between two alternative and seemingly degenerate acetyl-CoA assimilation routes in the alphaproteobacterium Paracoccus denitrificans Pd1222: the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) and the glyoxylate cycle (GC). The EMCP and the GC each tightly control the balance between catabolism and anabolism by shifting flux away from the oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle toward biomass formation. However, the simultaneous presence of both the EMCP and GC in P. denitrificans Pd1222 raises the question of how this apparent functional degeneracy is globally coordinated during growth. Here, we show that RamB, a transcription factor of the ScfR family, controls expression of the GC in P. denitrificans Pd1222. Combining genetic, molecular biological and biochemical approaches, we identify the binding motif of RamB and demonstrate that CoA-thioester intermediates of the EMCP directly bind to the protein. Overall, our study shows that the EMCP and the GC are metabolically and genetically linked with each other, demonstrating a thus far undescribed bacterial strategy to achieve metabolic plasticity, in which one seemingly degenerate metabolic pathway directly drives expression of the other.IMPORTANCE Carbon metabolism provides organisms with energy and building blocks for cellular functions and growth. The tight regulation between degradation and assimilation of carbon substrates is central for optimal growth. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of metabolic control in bacteria is of importance for applications in health (e.g., targeting of metabolic pathways with new antibiotics, development of resistances) and biotechnology (e.g., metabolic engineering, introduction of new-to-nature pathways). In this study, we use the alphaproteobacterium P. denitrificans as model organism to study functional degeneracy, a well-known phenomenon of bacteria to use the same carbon source through two different (competing) metabolic routes. We demonstrate that two seemingly degenerate central carbon metabolic pathways are metabolically and genetically linked with each other, which allows the organism to control the switch between them in a coordinated manner during growth. Our study elucidates the molecular basis of metabolic plasticity in central carbon metabolism, which improves our understanding of how bacterial metabolism is able to partition fluxes between anabolism and catabolism.

AB Evidence indicates that obesity can be promoted by chemical 'obesogens' that drive adiposity, hunger, inflammation and suppress metabolism. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a lipid emulsifier and candidate obesogen in vitro, is widely used in processed foods, cosmetics and as stool softener medicines commonly used during pregnancy. In vivo testing of DOSS was performed in a developmental origins of adult obesity model. Pregnant mice were orally administered vehicle control or DOSS at times and doses comparable to stool softener use during human pregnancy. All weaned offspring consumed only standard diet. Adult male but not female offspring of DOSS-treated dams showed significantly increased body mass, overall and visceral fat masses, and decreased bone area. They exhibited significant decreases in plasma adiponectin and increases in leptin, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Inflammatory IL-6 was elevated, as was adipose Cox2 and Nox4 gene expressions, which may be associated with promoter DNA methylation changes. Multiple significant phospholipid/sterol lipid increases paralleled profiles from long-term high-fat diet induced obesity in males. Collectively, developmental DOSS exposure leads to increased adult adiposity, inflammation, metabolic disorder and dyslipidemia in offspring fed a standard diet, suggesting that pharmaceutical and other sources of DOSS taken during human pregnancy might contribute to long-term obesity-related health concerns in offspring.

AB Assessing adolescent sexual identity is complicated, and contemporary sexual identities are gaining greater complexity and variation. However, current measures do not capture the diversity of contemporary identities among adolescents. Thus, our study utilized a large national data set of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 years (N = 2,558) in the United States to propose a taxonomy of sexual identities among adolescents. Participants responded to a close-ended sexual identity question, followed by an open-ended qualitative question. Using the steps outlined in content analysis procedures, two researchers independently coded the open-ended responses, which were then discussed to establish consensus. Coding of open-ended responses to the sexual identity question resulted in eight categories, with more than 25% of adolescents identifying with less common sexual identity labels. We further tested differences in sexual identity among responses to the close-ended question, sociodemographic characteristics, and mental health outcomes using chi-square and analysis of variance tests. We found overall differences in sexual identification by close-ended responses, age, and assigned sex at birth. However, we did not find any difference in sexual identity by race and ethnicity or urbanicity. We also found differences in sexual identity by mental health symptoms and suicidal outcomes, especially among respondents who identified with less common sexual identity labels. Findings from our study provide cutting-edge information on sexual identities that better captures the current state of adolescent sexual identity classification in the United States. Future research should employ this taxonomy of eight sexual identity categories to collect data that reflect contemporary evidence. Public Significance Statement Findings of this study of the diverse sexual identities among adolescents suggest that, compared to adolescents reporting more common identities (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual), those reporting less common sexual identities (e.g., pansexual, queer) are at greater risk for negative mental health outcomes. Further, because these less common sexual identities are often not captured using current measures, the authors propose a more diverse categorical list of eight sexual identities that could be used by researchers to collect this important demographic information in future studies.

TI Substantial Differences in Turnover Intention Between Direct Care

AB Objectives: High retention rates among direct care workers (DCWs) affect the quality of aged care. However, limited research has explored factors associated with retention in China's aged care industry. This study compared turnover intention among DCWs in Chinese hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
   Design: A cross-sectional survey with the stratified-random sampling method. Setting and Participants: A total of 370 DCWs from 7 hospitals and 311 DCWs from 7 LTCFs located in Fujian Province, China, were surveyed.
   Measures: Turnover intention, contractual status, income, sociodemographic characteristics, and other work-related factors were self-reported by surveyed DCWs.
   Results: Approximately 80% of DCWs in hospitals had employment contracts, whereas only 9% of DCWs were contractual in LTCFs. DCWs from hospitals reported lower turnover intention (20.5% vs. 37.0%) than did DCWs from LTCFs. Contracted DCWs from hospitals had the lowest turnover intention (14.8%). Contracted and noncontracted DCWs in LTCFs were more likely to report turnover intention than hospital contracted DCWs (odds ratio [OR] 3.68, P = .008 and OR = 3.17, P <.001, respectively).
   Conclusions and Implications: Contractual status and facility type were jointly associated with turnover intention of DCWs in China. DCWs in LTCFs were likely to report much higher turnover intention than contracted DCWs in hospitals. The expanded use of employment contracts may lower turnover intention in long-term care DCWs by improving their job stability and security. The labor market of DCWs needs to be regulated by the Chinese Labor Law. (C) 2020 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

ID SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES; EXPERIENCE; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES; RECOVERY;
   THERAPY; EMOTION
AB Research suggests that music can affect mood and physiological states (Elliott, Polman, & McGregor, 2011; Thoma et al., 2013). The extant literature has mainly focused on long-term changes in self-report measures resulting from several sessions of music intervention (but see Jiang, Zhou, Rickson, & Jiang, 2013 and Pelletier, 2004 for review). The purpose of this study was to expand the previous work in three major ways. First, the stress-reducing effects of music listening versus musical improvisation on a xylophone were compared. Second, psychophysiological measures of stress were utilized in addition to self-report measures. Third, stress reduction effects were measured in one session. A total of 105 participants completed a stressor task and were then assigned to one of three recovery conditions: control (CG), music listening (ML), or music improvisation (MI). The ML and MI groups were expected to exhibit greater stress reduction (evidenced by behavioral and physiological measures) than the CG. Self-report and skin conductance (electrodermal activity; EDA) measures were used to assess response during the stressor task and recovery session. Results indicated that participants exhibited a significant increase in stress response as a result of the stressor task. Although self-report measures indicated that mood improved during the recovery session, the MI group exhibited only differential effects for levels of satisfaction. The physiological data showed greater stress reduction for the ML condition as compared with the CG and MI group.

AB Public Significance Statement In a time of extraordinary global crises and major threats to the legitimacy of psychological knowledge, this special issue invites psychologists to embrace the challenge of recommitting to publicly engaged and public-facing psychology. This article introduces the special issue and highlights key themes of an emergent public psychology framework.
   Psychology's role in public life and social issues has been of longstanding concern throughout the discipline. In a historical moment of tremendous social, political, and economic strife and a global pandemic, this special issue of American Psychologist seeks to extend important discourse about the concept of public psychology. The articles included in the special issue address a range of interconnected themes, including: (a) centering social problems, (b) engaging diverse publics in knowledge creation, (c) communicating and democratizing psychological knowledge, and (d) rethinking what constitutes psychology. In this introduction, the guest editors contextualize the special issue, identify its aims, and highlight the key contributions of the included articles. The guest editors argue that realizing an expansive and transformative public psychology will require structural, substantive changes within the discipline to place community concerns at the center of psychology. Nonetheless, bolstered by the insights of the special issue's contributors, the guest editors conclude with cautious optimism that psychology has much to offer in addressing the most pressing social problems of the 21st century.

AB Amphibian populations are being threatened by human related activities including the spread of the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and urbanization. With growing losses in global amphibian biodiversity, it is essential to document how amphibian populations are responding to rapid environmental changes. While most evolutionary processes, e.g. changes in allelic frequencies, may be too slow to allow adequate response to environmental changes, epigenetic modifications can rapidly translate environmental changes into adaptive phenotypic responses. Epigenetic modifications come in multiple, non-exclusive forms, the most notable being DNA methylation. Here we sought to examine variation in the frequency of DNA methylation among four tungara frog populations distributed across Gamboa, Panama; which vary in both their level of fungal presence/prevalence and urbanization. DNA samples were collected from amplexed (male-female) pairs and frequency of DNA methylation was analyzed using a methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism protocol. We found significant variation in DNA methylation among populations, and correlations between Bd infection status and methylation patterns. Urbanization, however, had no influences on the frequency of DNA methylation. These data suggest epigenetic modifications are substantially flexible across fine-scale, environmental gradients and there appears to be possible biologically relevant links between DNA methylation and Bd infection status. Our results provide a basis for future work investigating the causal role epigenetics have in mediating phenotypic response to human-induced, environmental changes.

DE effective field theory; Bayesian; parameter estimation; nucleon-nucleon

ID RENORMALIZATION; REGULARIZATION; SCATTERING
AB We recently developed a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation in general effective field theories. Here we present selected results from using that framework to estimate parameters with a nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential derived using chiral effective field theory (chi EFT): the semi-local NN potential of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei beta ner (EKM). There are many NN scattering data, up to high energies, and with rather small errors. Imposing a penalty for unnatural low-energy constants (LECs) therefore has a small effect on the fits, unless only a small fraction of the NN data is used in the fit. In contrast, we have found that including an estimate of higher orders in chi EFT plays an important role in robust parameter estimation. We present two case studies where our Bayesian machinery illuminates physics issues. The first involves the EKM potential at fourth order in the chi EFT expansion: the two-dimensional posterior probability density function (pdf) for the fourth-order s-wave LECs obtained from the Nijmegen PWA93 phase shifts indicates these parameters in the NN potential are degenerate. We trace this feature of the pdf to the presence of an operator in the fourth-order NN potential that vanishes on-shell. The second case study examines the stability of LEC extractions as more data at higher energies are included in the fit. We show that as long as chi EFT truncation errors are properly accounted for in the parameter estimation, the LEC values extracted using our Bayesian approach are not sensitive to the maximum energy chosen for the fit. Uncorrelated and fully correlated models for the truncation errors are compared, pointing the way to the use of Gaussian processes to more generally model the correlation structure.

TI Quantifying correlated truncation errors in effective field theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATION; INFERENCE
AB Effective field theories (EFTs) organize the description of complex systems into an infinite sequence of decreasing importance. Predictions are made with a finite number of terms, which induces a truncation error that is often left unquantified. We formalize the notion of EFT convergence and propose a Bayesian truncation error model for predictions that are correlated across the independent variables, e.g., energy or scattering angle. Central to our approach are Gaussian processes that encode both the naturalness and correlation structure of EFT coefficients. Our use of Gaussian processes permits efficient and accurate assessment of credible intervals, allows EFT fits to easily include correlated theory errors, and provides analytic posteriors for physical EFT-related quantities such as the expansion parameter. We demonstrate that model-checking diagnostics-applied to the case of multiple curves-are powerful tools for EFT validation. As an example, we assess a set of nucleonnucleon scattering observables in chiral EFT. In an effort to be self-contained, appendices include thorough derivations of our statistical results. Our methods are packaged in Python code, called gsum, that is available for download on GitHub.

AB The extant research sheds light on the vital role of co-creation in online healthcare communities (OHCs) as nascent peer-to-peer co-creation platforms in public health and well-being. However, more investigation of the underlying factors affecting patient value co-creation in OHCs is required. This study relies on the socio-technical theory to identify the social and technical factors that impact healthcare users' intention to co-create value. Analysis of survey data gathered from users of Top 10 healthcare-based pages on Facebook indicated that both social and technical factors are salient in the prediction of value co-creation in OHCs. More specifically, social support and its antecedents (i.e., perceived privacy risk and social media interactivity), as well as government IT infrastructures and perceived control of information, are found to be the critical antecedents of value co-creation intention. However, social support emerged as the most potent predictor of value co-creation relative to government IT infrastructures and control of information. The theoretical and practical contributions of the findings are discussed.

AB We face a crisis of interconnected environmental and human health problems rooted in policies, behaviors, and social inequalities that behavioral medicine can address with ecological and community-based approaches.
   Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine's rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.

AB Vocalizations play a critical role in mate recognition and mate choice in a number of taxa, especially, but not limited to, orthopterans, frogs, and birds. But receivers can only recognize and prefer sounds that they can hear. Thus a fundamental question linking neurobiology and sexual selection asks-what is the threshold for detecting acoustic sexual displays? In this study, we use 3 methods to assess such thresholds in tungara frogs: behavioral responses, auditory brainstem responses, and multiunit electrophysiological recordings from the midbrain. We show that thresholds are lowest for multiunit recordings (ca. 45 dB SPL), and then for behavioral responses (ca. 61 dB SPL), with auditory brainstem responses exhibiting the highest thresholds (ca. 71 dB SPL). We discuss why these estimates differ and why, as with other studies, it is unlikely that they should be the same. Although all of these studies estimate thresholds they are not measuring the same thresholds; behavioral thresholds are based on signal salience whereas the 2 neural assays estimate physiological thresholds. All 3 estimates, however, make it clear that to have an appreciation for detection and salience of acoustic signals we must listen to those signals through the ears of the receivers.

AB Chesapeake Bay water quality has been a concern since 1970. In rural areas, agriculture is the dominant N and P source, and the voluntary application of best management practices (BMPs) is the primary management tool. Here we test the hypothesis that the current management approach of primarily voluntary, untargeted BMP implementation is insufficient to create detectable, widespread reductions in N, P, and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in agricultural watersheds of the Choptank basin, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay. To test this hypothesis, we assessed BMP implementation and sampled water quality on participating farms, at intermediate streams within each watershed, and at watershed outlets of four watersheds from 2013 to 2014. We also present water quality data from 2003 to 2014 at the outlets of 12 additional agricultural and one forested watershed and survey-directed interviews of farmers. By the end of 2014, large numbers of BMPs, both structural and cultural, had been implemented. Of the 16 agricultural watersheds, 50% showed significant decreases in baseflow N, 37.5% showed no changes, and 12.5% showed increasing TN. Baseflow P significantly decreased at just one watershed, increased at one, and remained stable at 14. Stormflow N was similar to baseflow, but stormflow P was 5 times higher than baseflow. These data partially support our hypothesis. Surveys suggested farmers considered themselves responsible for the quality of water leaving their farms, but out-of-pocket cost was the major impediment to further BMP adoption. We suggest that greater outreach and more financial support for farmers to implement BMPs is required to increase the types and densities of BMPs needed to achieve regional water quality goals.

AB Communication systems often include a variety of components, including those that span modalities, which may facilitate detection and decision-making. For example, female tungara frogs and fringelipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male tu ' ngara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of acommunication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.

ID CARDIAC MYXOMA
AB Introduction and importance: Atrial myxomas account for more than half of all cardiac tumors. While the symptoms of these are many, the most prominent among them being migraines, heart failure, dyspnea, and chest pain thereby making a diagnosis all the more difficult.Case presentation: A 53-year-old woman presented with a recent onset of headaches with aura. The latter was triggered by exercise and physical exertion. Taking Ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily provided relief to the patient. Headaches were associated with photophobia and nausea.Clinical discussion: The patient had the typical triad of symptoms, namely (i) obstructive (light headedness, near syncope, dyspnea, chest pain), (ii) embolic (transient ischemic attacks - TIA, peripheral arterial claudication), and (iii) constitutional (fever, malaise, weight loss). Cerebral infarction is the most frequent complication. The patient had multiple embolic acute and sub-acute infarcts. The aura and headaches were resolved following resection of the myxoma. Conclusion: Atrial myxomas must enter the differential diagnosis in the case of a patient presenting with migraines associated with aura. In particular, those whose headaches increase with physical exertion require further investigation.

AB The Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA) is the primary professional home for community psychologists in the United States and increasingly around the world. Since the formation of the American Psychological Association Division 27: Community Psychology in 1966, now SCRA, 54 people have served in the Presidential role. Presidential leaders' annual addresses both reflect the current state of the field and have the ability to shape the future of both SCRA as an organization and community psychology as a discipline given their positions as leaders. This commentary explores the trajectory of SCRA as an organization via 33 available presidential addresses, 28 of which were published in the American Journal of Community Psychology (AJCP). Using thematic analysis and drawing on both dialectical and life cycle organizational processes, three periods of SCRA and community psychology more broadly were identified: defining community psychology, applying community psychology, and re-imagining community psychology. Themes speak to tensions between the ideals of the society and the work of the society. We conclude by offering a series of questions for consideration as SCRA positions itself for the future.

TI Rigorous constraints on three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field
   theory from fast and accurate calculations of few-body observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY-LEVELS; LIGHT-NUCLEI; HALF-LIFE; SYSTEM; STATES
AB We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (xEFT) that are provided by bound-state observables in the A = 3 and A = 4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to truncation of the xEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H I3-decay rate can only be obtained if xEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The I3-decay rate is the only one of these that yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. We find a xEFT expansion parameter of Q = 0.33 +/- 0.06 for these observables.

AB Mesophotic reef corals remain largely unexplored in terms of the genetic adaptations and physiological mechanisms to acquire, allocate, and use energy for survival and reproduction. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Leptoseris species complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique community. To study how the ecophysiology of Leptoseris species relates to symbiont-host specialization and understand the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in extreme low light environments, we examined Symbiodinium (endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics and the lipids and isotopic signatures from Symbiodinium and coral hosts over a depth-dependent light gradient (55-7 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), 60-132 m). Clear performance differences demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in photoacclimatization depends primarily on Symbiodinium type. Colonies harboring Symbiodinium sp. COI-2 showed significant increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing depth, whereas colonies harboring Symbiodinium spp. COI-1 and COI-3 showed variability in pigment composition, yield measurements for photosystem II, as well as size and density of Symbiodinium cells. Despite remarkable differences in photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant differences among lipids of Leptoseris species with depth. Finally, isotopic signatures of both host and Symbiodinium changed with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired energy from different sources depending on depth. This study highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and to successfully establish and compete in extreme light-limited environments.

AB Forests are a key component of hydrological cycles, and thus deforestation is likely to affect the availability and quality of water for downstream agricultural production. However, in humid tropical regions where water is relatively abundant and the terrain is relatively flat, it is unclear whether these changes in ecosystem services matter to local farmers. We test whether the extent of forest in upstream drainage areas affects downstream farm production in an agricultural colonization zone in the Brazilian Amazon. We first estimate panel models of the output of milk, which is the primary farm product in our study region. We then test for effects on pasture stocking and cow productivity as possible pathways for the effect of upstream forests on milk output. Estimation results suggest that upstream forest increases the productivity of properties with small drainage areas. The effects are strongest when water is either scarce (dry season of drought years) or excessive (rainy season of flood years). The contribution of Amazonian forests to the resilience of the local farm economy is likely to become more important as rainfall becomes more variable due to regional and global climate change.

AB We examine the effects of the balance between positive and negative affect experienced at work on well-being outcomes. An extensive literature on affect balance suggests that it is not only positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) alone that affect well-being; rather it is the balance between them that matters. We use experience sampling methods and polynomial regression to test the notion that daily PA and NA at work, along with their interactive and nonlinear effects, predict employee well-being after work. In a sample of working adults, we find that affect balance-the dynamic interplay between daily PA and NA-at work was differentially associated with various indices of well-being: PA, NA, and the interaction between them predicted physical and mental health. Affect balance at work also predicted life satisfaction, but only for those low on trait affect balance. Detailed examination of the joint effects of PA, NA, and the balance between them reveals that high PA at work is most important for life satisfaction, whereas both low NA and high PA are important for health. Low NA plays an especially important role in physical health.

AB The rest-frame far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colour-redshift relationship has been constructed from data on over 480 000 quasars carefully cross-matched between SDSS Data Release 14 and the final GALEX photometric catalogue. UV matching and detection probabilities are given for all the quasars, including dependencies on separation, optical brightness, and redshift. Detection limits are also provided for all objects. The UV colour distributions are skewed redward at virtually all redshifts, especially when detection limits are accounted for. The median GALEX far-UV minus near-UV (FUV - NUV) colour-redshift relation is reliably determined up to z approximate to 2.8, corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths as short as 400 angstrom. Extreme UV (EUV) colours are substantially redder than found previously, when detection limits are properly accounted for. Quasar template spectra were forward modelled through the GALEX bandpasses, accounting for intergalactic opacity, intrinsic reddening, and continuum slope variations. Intergalactic absorption by itself cannot account for the very red EUV colours. The colour-redshift relation is consistent with no intrinsic reddening, at least for SMC-like extinction. The best model fit has a FUV continuum power-law slope alpha(v,) (FUV) = -0.34 +/- 0.03 consistent with previous results, but an EUV slope alpha(v, EUV) = -2.90 +/- 0.04 that is much redder and inconsistent with any previous composite value (all greater than or similar to -2.0). The EUV slope difference can be attributed in part to the tendency of previous studies to preferentially select UV brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux suggests quasar accretion disc models that include outflows such as disc winds.

AB As both public health and public libraries continue to evolve, there are opportunities for collaboration focused on building policies, systems, and environments that support communities making healthy choices easy choices. Given the health disparities related to physical inactivity, such as diabetes and heart disease in rural America, public libraries within rural communities are emerging as important settings for health promotion and disease prevention. This study sought to better understand how rural libraries promote physical activity opportunities on Facebook. Based on a content analysis of Facebook posts of a random sample of 118 libraries made during the Summer of 2022, 47 of the 118 had at least one post related to physical activity and 42 had multiple posts. The most frequent offering was events or classes; libraries also supported physical activity by lending equipment and making changes to the built environment. This study provides evidence that some rural libraries are offering physical activity opportunities through community health partnerships, particularly for youth and families. Considering this evidence, public health professionals are encouraged to collaborate with local libraries to promote physical activity and advance rural health equity. Researchers are invited to continue to develop the evidence base around promoting physical activity with rural libraries.

AB Reptile-associated human salmonellosis cases have increased recently in the United States. It is not uncommon to find healthy chelonians shedding Salmonella enterica. The rate and frequency of bacterial shedding are not fully understood, and most studies have focused on captive vs. free-living chelonians and often in relation to an outbreak. Their ecology and significance as sentinels are important to understanding Salmonella transmission. In 2012-2013, Salmonella prevalence was determined for free-living aquatic turtles in man-made ponds in Clarke and Oconee Counties, in northern Georgia (USA) and the correlation between species, basking ecology, demographics (age/sex), season, or landcover with prevalence was assessed. The genetic relatedness between turtle and archived, human isolates, as well as, other archived animal and water isolates reported from this study area was examined. Salmonella was isolated from 45 of 194 turtles (23.2%, range 14-100%) across six species. Prevalence was higher in juveniles (36%) than adults (20%), higher in females (33%) than males (18%), and higher in bottom-dwelling species (31%; common and loggerhead musk turtles, common snapping turtles) than basking species (15%; sliders, painted turtles). Salmonella prevalence decreased as forest cover, canopy cover, and distance from roads increased. Prevalence was also higher in low-density, residential areas that have 20-49% impervious surface. A total of 9 different serovars of two subspecies were isolated including 3 S. enterica subsp. arizonae and 44 S. enterica subsp. enterica (two turtles had two serotypes isolated from each). Among the S. enterica serovars, Montevideo (n = 13) and Rubislaw (n = 11) were predominant. Salmonella serovars Muenchen, Newport, Mississippi, Inverness, Brazil, and Paratyphi B. var L(+) tartrate positive (Java) were also isolated. Importantly, 85% of the turtle isolates matched pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of human isolates, including those reported from Georgia. Collectively, these results suggest that turtles accumulate Salmonella present in water bodies, and they may be effective sentinels of environmental contamination. Ultimately, the Salmonella prevalence rates in wild aquatic turtles, especially those strains shared with humans, highlight a significant public health concern.

AB Tool use is a fundamental feature of human evolution. Stone tools are in the archaeological record from 3.4 Ma, even before Homo,1 and the use of stone tools probably predated the split between hominins and pan-ins.2 Using tools (hereafter, tooling cf Fragaszy and Mangalam3) is hypothesized to have improved hominins' foraging efficiency or access to high-quality foods.4-7 This hypothesis is supported if feeding with tools posi-tively contributes to diet quality in extant non-human primates or if foraging efficiency is increased by tooling. However, the contribution of tooling to non-human primates' foraging success has never been investigated through a direct analysis of nutritional ecology.8,9 We used multi-dimensional nutritional geometry to analyze energy and macronutrients (nonstructural carbohydrates, lipids, and protein) in the diets of wild capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinous) that routinely crack palm nuts with stone hammers.10,11 We show that eating nuts obtained through tooling helps monkeys to achieve more consistent dietary intakes. Tooling increased the net energy gain by 50% and decreased the proportion of fiber ingested by 7%. Tooling also increased the daily non-protein energy intake. By contrast, protein intake remained constant across foraging days, sug-gesting a pattern of macronutrient regulation called protein prioritization, which is also found in contempo-rary humans.8,9 In addition, tooling reduced dispersion in the ratio of protein to non-protein energy, suggest-ing a role in macronutrient balancing. Our findings suggest that tooling prior to tool making could have substantially increased the nutritional security of ancestral hominins, sowing the seeds for cultural develop-ment.5,7

AB Free-living nematodes respond to variable and unpredictable environmental stimuli whereas parasitic nematodes exist in a more stable host environment. A positive correlation between the presence of environmental stages in the nematode life cycle and an increasing number of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) reflects this difference in free-living and parasitic lifestyles. As hookworm larvae move from the external environment into a host, they detect uncharacterized host components, initiating a signalling cascade that results in the resumption of development and eventual maturation. Previous studies suggest this process is mediated by GPCRs in amphidial neurons. Here we set out to uncover candidate GPCRs required by a hookworm to recognise its host. First, we identified all potential Ancylostoma ceylanicum GPCRs encoded in the genome. We then used life cycle stage-specific RNA-seq data to identify differentially expressed GPCRs between the free-living infective L3 (iL3) and subsequent parasitic stages to identify receptors involved in the transition to parasitism. We reasoned that GPCRs involved in host recognition and developmental activation would be expressed at higher levels in the environmental iL3 stage than in subsequent stages. Our results support the model that a decrease in GPCR diversity occurs as the larvae develop from the free-living iL3 stage to the parasitic L3 (pL3) in the host over 24-72 h. We find that overall GPCR expression and diversity is highest in the iL3 compared with subsequent parasitic stages. By 72 h, there was an approximately 50% decrease in GPCR richness associated with the moult from the pL3 to the L4. Taken together, our data uncover a negative correlation between GPCR diversity and parasitic development in hookworm. Finally, we demonstrate proof of principal that Caenorhabditis elegans can be used as a heterologous system to examine the expression pattern of candidate host signal chemoreceptors (CRs) from hookworm. We observe expression of candidate host signal CRs in C. elegans, demonstrating that C. elegans can be effectively used as a surrogate to identify expressed hookworm genes. We present several preliminary examples of this strategy and confirm a candidate CR as neuronally expressed. (C) 2020 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Multiplicity Statistics of Stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal
   Galaxy: Comparison to the Milky Way
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS

ID VELOCITY DISPERSION; EVOLUTION
AB We use time-resolved spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to examine the distribution of radial velocity (RV) variations in 249 stars identified as members of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy by Hayes et al. We select Milky Way (MW) stars that have stellar parameters (log(g), T-eff, and [Fe/H] ) similar to those of the Sagittarius members by means of a k-d tree of dimension 3. We find that the shape of the distribution of RV shifts in Sgr dSph stars is similar to that measured in their MW analogs, but the total fraction of RV variable stars in the Sgr dSph is larger by a factor of similar to 2. After ruling out other explanations for this difference, we conclude that the fraction of close binaries in the Sgr dSph is intrinsically higher than in the MW. We discuss the implications of this result for the physical processes leading to the formation of close binaries in dwarf spheroidal and spiral galaxies.

AB Draco C1 is a known symbiotic binary star system composed of a carbon red giant and a hot, compact companion-likely a white dwarf-belonging to the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. From near-infrared spectroscopic observations taken by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, we provide updated stellar parameters for the cool, giant component, and constrain the temperature and mass of the hot, compact companion. Prior measurements of the periodicity of the system, based on only a few epochs of radial velocity data or relatively short baseline photometric observations, were sufficient only to place lower limits on the orbital period (P > 300 days). For the first time, we report precise orbital parameters for the binary system: with 43 radial velocity measurements from APOGEE spanning an observational baseline of more than 3 yr, we definitively derive the period of the system to be 1220.0(-3.5)(+3.7) days. Based on the newly derived orbital period and separation of the system, together with estimates of the radius of the red giant star, we find that the hot companion must be accreting matter from the dense wind of its evolved companion.

AB Background Little is known about the relationship between sleep and obesity in young adults, particularly college students. This study examined the relationship between sleep (i.e., sleep duration and quality) and obesity in a large and diverse binational sample of college students. Methods Analyses were based on a 40-item paper survey from 2016/2017 to 2017/2018 academic years, with a 72% response rate. The samples were 1578 college students aged 18-25 years from five universities (two in the U.S. and three in South Korea). Weight and height were measured objectively; other measures (e.g., health behaviors) were self-reported. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between sleep duration and independent variables (race/nationality, gender, and BMI). Poisson regression was used to examine the relationship between sleep quality and independent variables. Results Overall, blacks had a higher adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of short sleep (< 7 h/night) than whites (AOR = 1.74, P < .01); overweight participants had a higher AOR of short sleep than normal weight participants (AOR = 1.52, P < .01); and obese participants had a higher AORs of both short and long sleep (> 9 h/night) (AOR = 1.67, P < .01; AOR = 1.79, P < .05, respectively). Among men, being black, overweight, and obesity were associated with short sleep (P < .05), whereas only obesity was related to short sleep among women (P < .05). In analyses stratified by race and nationality, overweight and obesity were related to short sleep among blacks only (P < .05). Overall, sleep quality (getting enough sleep to feel rested in the morning in the past 7 days) was worse in blacks and South Koreans than whites (P < .05), worse in women than men (P < .05), and worse in participants with obesity than normal weight participants (P < .05). Conclusions Obesity was associated with both short (< 7 h/night) and long sleep duration (> 9 h/night) and poor sleep quality among all participants. In comparison with whites, blacks were more like to have short sleep, and blacks and South Koreans had worse sleep quality. Further investigations using a larger sample of college students in multiple countries may be helpful to identify target populations who are at a greater risk of obesity and sleep problems.

AB Solutions to our most pressing environmental problems demand the development and application of leadership skills that are not typically fostered in traditional academic programs: skills that advance new transdisciplinary approaches to co-produce knowledge that can be mobilized for action. We outline a new collective leadership model with six dimensions, Inquire, Connect, Engage, Strategize, Empower, and Reflect, and show through a series of case studies how each of these leadership dimensions can be used to create positive and lasting change for people and their environments. We also describe how academic researchers can learn to apply these dimensions in their own work and introduce a series of companion online narratives and teaching resources designed to facilitate the use of this collective leadership model in classrooms.

AB We use observations from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to explore the relationship between stellar parameters and multiplicity. We combine high-resolution repeat spectroscopy for 41 363 dwarf and subgiant stars with abundance measurements from the APOGEE pipeline and distances and stellar parameters derived using Gaia DR2 parallaxes from Sanders & Das to identify and characterize stellar multiples with periods below 30 yr, corresponding to Delta RVmax greater than or similar to 3 km s(-1), where Delta RVmax is the maximum APOGEE-detected shift in the radial velocities. Chemical composition is responsible for most of the variation in the close binary fraction in our sample, with stellar parameters like mass and age playing a secondary role. In addition to the previously identified strong anticorrelation between the close binary fraction and [Fe/H], we find that high abundances of alpha elements also suppress multiplicity at most values of [Fe/H] sampled by APOGEE. The anticorrelation between alpha abundances and multiplicity is substantially steeper than that observed for Fe, suggesting C, O, and Si in the form of dust and ices dominate the opacity of primordial protostellar discs and their propensity for fragmentation via gravitational stability. Near [Fe/H] = 0 dex, the bias-corrected close binary fraction (a < 10 au) decreases from approximate to 100 per cent at [alpha/H] = -0.2 dex to approximate to 15 per cent near [alpha/H] = 0.08 dex, with a suggestive turn-up to approximate to 20 per cent near [alpha/H] = 0.2. We conclude that the relationship between stellar multiplicity and chemical composition for sun-like dwarf stars in the field of the Milky Way is complex, and that this complexity should be accounted for in future studies of interacting binaries.

AB Climate change and land-use change are leading drivers of biodiversity decline, affecting demographic parameters that are important for population persistence. For example, scientists have speculated for decades that climate change may skew adult sex ratios in taxa that express temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), but limited evidence exists that this phenomenon is occurring in natural settings. For species that are vulnerable to anthropogenic land-use practices, differential mortality among sexes may also skew sex ratios. We sampled the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a freshwater species with TSD, across a large portion of its geographic range (Florida to Maine), to assess the environmental factors influencing adult sex ratios. We present evidence that suggests recent climate change has potentially skewed the adult sex ratio of spotted turtles, with samples following a pattern of increased proportions of females concomitant with warming trends, but only within the warmer areas sampled. At intermediate temperatures, there was no relationship with climate, while in the cooler areas we found the opposite pattern, with samples becoming more male biased with increasing temperatures. These patterns might be explained in part by variation in relative adaptive capacity via phenotypic plasticity in nest site selection. Our findings also suggest that spotted turtles have a context-dependent and multi-scale relationship with land use. We observed a negative relationship between male proportion and the amount of crop cover (within 300 m) when wetlands were less spatially aggregated. However, when wetlands were aggregated, sex ratios remained consistent. This pattern may reflect sex-specific patterns in movement that render males more vulnerable to mortality from agricultural machinery and other threats. Our findings highlight the complexity of species' responses to both climate change and land use, and emphasize the role that landscape structure can play in shaping wildlife population demographics.

AB Landscape context is integral to population ecology, affecting a range of life history parameters, yet very little is known about how landscape structure influences many taxa. We sampled wetlands at 531 sites across 16 states in the eastern U.S. to examine the influence of landscape heterogeneity and anthropogenic land use on the relative abundance of freshwater turtles, one of the most endangered vertebrate clades in the world. Specifically, we aimed to understand how two components of landscape structure - compositional heterogeneity (wetland di-versity) and configurational heterogeneity (wetland aggregation) - influence turtles with varying life history traits. Our results suggest that wetland configuration can modulate the relationship between relative abundance and anthropogenic land use. For example, spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) was negatively associated with hay/ pasture cover when wetlands were less aggregated, but this relationship subsided as aggregation increased. Notably, the way wetland aggregation modulated land use relationships varied across species. These results suggest that some anthropogenic cover types are not strictly positive or negative for certain species, but are instead context-dependent. Relative abundance also generally increased with higher wetland diversity, indi-cating the potential importance of landscape supplementation for turtles. We report a range of responses to roads that did not strictly correspond with well-established predictions related to body size and terrestrial activity patterns, including positive associations for certain species. Overall, our study supports the use of context-driven approaches to land use-related conservation and management decisions rather than blanket prescriptions, and further emphasizes that effective conservation of freshwater systems requires a landscape-level perspective.

AB We measure rotational broadening in spectra taken by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to characterize the relationship between stellar multiplicity and rotation. We create a sample of 2786 giants and 24 496 dwarfs with stellar parameters and multiple radial velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds vsin i determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by Sanders & Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the radial velocities, Delta RVmax, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits on expected vsin i and Delta RVmax values. These expectations agree with the positive correlation between the maximum Delta RVmax and vsin i values observed in our sample as a function of log(g). We find that the fast rotators in our sample have a high occurrence of short-period [log(P/d) less than or similar to 4] companions. We also find that old, rapidly rotating main-sequence stars have larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers. Furthermore, rapidly rotating stars with large Delta RVmax consistently show differences of 1-10 Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.

AB Many problems in contemporary astrophysics-from understanding the formation of black holes to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies-rely on knowledge about binary stars. This, in turn, depends on the discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational epochs, which allows for binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through radial velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,495 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P less than or similar to few years, a less than or similar to few
   <CDATA
   <i ) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,495 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic "discovery" threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about binary-star populations and subthreshold searches.

TI Fourteen Recommendations to Create a More Inclusive Environment for
   LGBTQ plus Individuals in Academic Biology

AB Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and otherwise nonstraight and/or non-cisgender (LGBTQ+) have often not felt welcome or represented in the biology community. Additionally, biology can present unique challenges for LGBTQ+ students because of the relationship between certain biology topics and their LGBTQ+ identities. Currently, there is no centralized set of guidelines to make biology learning environments more inclusive for LGBTQ+ individuals. Rooted in prior literature and the collective expertise of the authors who identify as members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community, we present a set of actionable recommendations to help biologists, biology educators, and biology education researchers be more inclusive of individuals with LGBTQ+ identities. These recommendations are intended to increase awareness of LGBTQ+ identities and spark conversations about transforming biology learning spaces and the broader academic biology community to become more inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals.

AB During the 21st century, human-environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human-environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.

AB The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is a dual-hemisphere, near-infrared (NIR), spectroscopic survey with the goal of producing a chemodynamical mapping of the Milky Way. The targeting for APOGEE-2 is complex and has evolved with time. In this paper, we present the updates and additions to the initial targeting strategy for APOGEE-2N presented in Zasowski et al. (2017). These modifications come in two implementation modes: (i) "Ancillary Science Programs" competitively awarded to Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV PIs through proposal calls in 2015 and 2017 for the pursuit of new scientific avenues outside the main survey, and (ii) an effective 1.5 yr expansion of the survey, known as the Bright Time Extension (BTX), made possible through accrued efficiency gains over the first years of the APOGEE-2N project. For the 23 distinct ancillary programs, we provide descriptions of the scientific aims, target selection, and how to identify these targets within the APOGEE-2 sample. The BTX permitted changes to the main survey strategy, the inclusion of new programs in response to scientific discoveries or to exploit major new data sets not available at the outset of the survey design, and expansions of existing programs to enhance their scientific success and reach. After describing the motivations, implementation, and assessment of these programs, we also leave a summary of lessons learned from nearly a decade of APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 survey operations. A companion paper, F. Santana et al. (submitted; AAS29036), provides a complementary presentation of targeting modifications relevant to APOGEE-2 operations in the Southern Hemisphere.

AB Relative brain sizes in birds can rival those of primates, but large-scale patterns and drivers of avian brain evolution remain elusive. Here, we explore the evolution of the fundamental brain-body scaling relationship across the origin and evolution of birds. Using a comprehensive dataset sampling>2,000 modern birds, fossil birds, and theropod dinosaurs, we infer patterns of brain-body co-variation in deep time. Our study confirms that no significant increase in relative brain size accompanied the trend toward miniaturization or evolution of flight during the theropod-bird transition. Critically, however, theropods and basal birds show weaker integration between brain size and body size, allowing for rapid changes in the brain-body relationship that set the stage for dramatic shifts in early crown birds. We infer that major shifts occurred rapidly in the aftermath of the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction within Neoaves, in which multiple clades achieved higher relative brain sizes because of a reduction in body size. Parrots and corvids achieved the largest brains observed in birds via markedly different patterns. Parrots primarily reduced their body size, whereas corvids increased body and brain size simultaneously (with rates of brain size evolution outpacing rates of body size evolution). Collectively, these patterns suggest that an early adaptive radiation in brain size laid the foundation for subsequent selection and stabilization.

AB The eighteenth data release (DR18) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is the first one for SDSS-V, the fifth generation of the survey. SDSS-V comprises three primary scientific programs or "Mappers": the Milky Way Mapper (MWM), the Black Hole Mapper (BHM), and the Local Volume Mapper. This data release contains extensive targeting information for the two multiobject spectroscopy programs (MWM and BHM), including input catalogs and selection functions for their numerous scientific objectives. We describe the production of the targeting databases and their calibration and scientifically focused components. DR18 also includes & SIM;25,000 new SDSS spectra and supplemental information for X-ray sources identified by eROSITA in its eFEDS field. We present updates to some of the SDSS software pipelines and preview changes anticipated for DR19. We also describe three value-added catalogs (VACs) based on SDSS-IV data that have been published since DR17, and one VAC based on the SDSS-V data in the eFEDS field.

TI Extensive regional variation in the phenology of insects and their

AB Climate change models often assume similar responses to temperatures across the range of a species, but local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity can lead plants and animals to respond differently to temperature in different parts of their range. To date, there have been few tests of this assumption at the scale of continents, so it is unclear if this is a large-scale problem. Here, we examined the assumption that insect taxa show similar responses to temperature at 96 sites in grassy habitats across North America. We sampled insects with Malaise traps during 2019-2021 (N = 1041 samples) and examined the biomass of insects in relation to temperature and time of season. Our samples mostly contained Diptera (33%), Lepidoptera (19%), Hymenoptera (18%), and Coleoptera (10%). We found strong regional differences in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature, even within the same taxonomic group, habitat type, and time of season. For example, the biomass of nematoceran flies increased across the season in the central part of the continent, but it only showed a small increase in the Northeast and a seasonal decline in the Southeast and West. At a smaller scale, insect biomass at different traps operating on the same days was correlated up to similar to 75 km apart. Large-scale geographic and phenological variation in insect biomass and abundance has not been studied well, and it is a major source of controversy in previous analyses of insect declines that have aggregated studies from different locations and time periods. Our study illustrates that large-scale predictions about changes in insect populations, and their causes, will need to incorporate regional and taxonomic differences in the response to temperature.

AB This paper documents the seventeenth data release (DR17) from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys; the fifth and final release from the fourth phase (SDSS-IV). DR17 contains the complete release of the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which reached its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. The complete release of the MaNGA Stellar Library accompanies this data, providing observations of almost 30,000 stars through the MaNGA instrument during bright time. DR17 also contains the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 survey that publicly releases infrared spectra of over 650,000 stars. The main sample from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), as well as the subsurvey Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey data were fully released in DR16. New single-fiber optical spectroscopy released in DR17 is from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey subsurvey and the eBOSS-RM program. Along with the primary data sets, DR17 includes 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper concludes the release of SDSS-IV survey data. SDSS continues into its fifth phase with observations already underway for the Milky Way Mapper, Local Volume Mapper, and Black Hole Mapper surveys.
