AB The rest-frame far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colour-redshift relationship has been constructed from data on over 480 000 quasars carefully cross-matched between SDSS Data Release 14 and the final GALEX photometric catalogue. UV matching and detection probabilities are given for all the quasars, including dependencies on separation, optical brightness, and redshift. Detection limits are also provided for all objects. The UV colour distributions are skewed redward at virtually all redshifts, especially when detection limits are accounted for. The median GALEX far-UV minus near-UV (FUV - NUV) colour-redshift relation is reliably determined up to z approximate to 2.8, corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths as short as 400 angstrom. Extreme UV (EUV) colours are substantially redder than found previously, when detection limits are properly accounted for. Quasar template spectra were forward modelled through the GALEX bandpasses, accounting for intergalactic opacity, intrinsic reddening, and continuum slope variations. Intergalactic absorption by itself cannot account for the very red EUV colours. The colour-redshift relation is consistent with no intrinsic reddening, at least for SMC-like extinction. The best model fit has a FUV continuum power-law slope alpha(v,) (FUV) = -0.34 +/- 0.03 consistent with previous results, but an EUV slope alpha(v, EUV) = -2.90 +/- 0.04 that is much redder and inconsistent with any previous composite value (all greater than or similar to -2.0). The EUV slope difference can be attributed in part to the tendency of previous studies to preferentially select UV brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux suggests quasar accretion disc models that include outflows such as disc winds.
