AB Landscape context is integral to population ecology, affecting a range of life history parameters, yet very little is known about how landscape structure influences many taxa. We sampled wetlands at 531 sites across 16 states in the eastern U.S. to examine the influence of landscape heterogeneity and anthropogenic land use on the relative abundance of freshwater turtles, one of the most endangered vertebrate clades in the world. Specifically, we aimed to understand how two components of landscape structure - compositional heterogeneity (wetland di-versity) and configurational heterogeneity (wetland aggregation) - influence turtles with varying life history traits. Our results suggest that wetland configuration can modulate the relationship between relative abundance and anthropogenic land use. For example, spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) was negatively associated with hay/ pasture cover when wetlands were less aggregated, but this relationship subsided as aggregation increased. Notably, the way wetland aggregation modulated land use relationships varied across species. These results suggest that some anthropogenic cover types are not strictly positive or negative for certain species, but are instead context-dependent. Relative abundance also generally increased with higher wetland diversity, indi-cating the potential importance of landscape supplementation for turtles. We report a range of responses to roads that did not strictly correspond with well-established predictions related to body size and terrestrial activity patterns, including positive associations for certain species. Overall, our study supports the use of context-driven approaches to land use-related conservation and management decisions rather than blanket prescriptions, and further emphasizes that effective conservation of freshwater systems requires a landscape-level perspective.
