TI High-resolution bathymetries and shorelines for the Great Lakes of the
   White Nile basin
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA

DT Article; Data Paper
ID DECLINE; PERCH
AB HRBS-GLWNB 2020 presents the first open-source and high-resolution bathymetry, shoreline, and water level data for Lakes Victoria, Albert, Edward, and George in East Africa. For each Lake, these data have three primary products collected for this project. The bathymetric datasets were created from approximately 18 million acoustic soundings. Over 8,200 km of shorelines are delineated across the three lakes from high-resolution satellite systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles. Finally, these data are tied together by creating lake surface elevation models collected from GPS and altimeter measures. The data repository includes additional derived products, including surface areas, water volumes, shoreline lengths, lake elevation levels, and geodetic information. These data can be used to make allocation decisions regarding the freshwater resources within Africa, manage food resources on which many tens of millions of people rely, and help preserve the region's endemic biodiversity. Finally, as these data are tied to globally consistent geodetic models, they can be used in future global and regional climate change models.

FX The surveys were conducted and coordinated by researchers from the
   National Fisheries Resources Research Institute (NaFIRRI) of Uganda, the
   Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), Tanzania
   Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI), the Lake Victoria Regional
   Hydroacoustic Working Group of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization,
   the University of Denver, Boston University, Salisbury University,
   Emerald Ocean Engineering LLC, and Gulf Coast GIS LLC. Funding for Lake
   Albert and Lake Edward was received from the African Development Bank
   (AfDB) through the Nile Basin Initiative - Nile Equatorial Lakes
   Subsidiary Action Program (NBI-NELSAP) under the Lakes Edward and Albert
   Integrated Fisheries and Water Resources Management Project (LEAF II
   Project). Funding for the Lake Victoria 2017 survey was received from
   the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award number v. Funding for
   the Lake Victoria 2018, 2019, and 2020 surveys were partially provided
   by Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH
   Responsible Fisheries Business Chains (RFBC) project number
   16.0126.9-102.00. Funding for Lake George came from matching
   contributions from NaFIRRI, Emerald Ocean Engineering LLC, and Gulf
   Coast GIS LLC. We want to acknowledge each vessel's respective boat
   captain and crew and the local personnel who assisted at each site. We
   recognize the Marine Nationale of DRC and the UPDF Marines of Uganda for
   providing security. We want to acknowledge Lake Edward's LEAF-II patrol
   boat crew for bringing us emergency fuel. We recognize Mr. Isingoma
   Philbert for taking daily water measurements at Lake Edward. We want to
   acknowledge USDA, NASA/PODAAC, AVISO, NOAA, and the TU-Delft/NOAA RADS
   database to provide the TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, Jason-2/OSTM, GFO, and
   SARAL altimetric datasets and parameters for use in establishing the
   water-level for Lake Victoria. Finally, we must acknowledge Planet, ESA,
   and the USGS for providing, PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Landsat imagery
   used in this data construction.
